Foreword
Today, 50 years on from the oil shock that led to the founding of the International Energy
Agency (IEA), the world once again faces a moment of high geopolitical tensions and
uncertainty for the energy sector. There are parallels between then and now, with oil
supplies in focus amid a crisis in the Middle East – but there are also key differences: the
global energy system has changed considerably since the early 1970s and further changes
are taking place rapidly before our eyes.
One thing that hasn’t changed since the 1970s is the IEA’s commitment to its core mission of
safeguarding energy security. As we have demonstrated throughout the global energy crisis
that erupted in February 2022, the IEA is ready to respond quickly and effectively to sudden
disruptions in energy markets. At the same time, we continue to dedicate significant efforts
to anticipating and addressing the challenges that are evolving and emerging across the
entire global energy system. This is an area where the data and analysis of the World Energy
Outlook (WEO) are so valuable.
With the insights of this new WEO in mind, I want to highlight some important differences
between where the energy sector was 50 years ago and where it is today. The 1973-74 crisis
was all about oil, but today’s pressures are coming from multiple areas. Alongside fragile oil
markets, the world has seen an acute crisis in natural gas markets caused by Russia’s cuts to
supply, which had strong knock-on effects on electricity. At the same time, the world is
dealing with an acute climate crisis, with increasingly visible effects of climate change caused
by the use of fossil fuels, including the record-breaking heatwaves experienced around the
world this year.
A crisis with multiple dimensions requires solutions that are similarly all-encompassing.
Ultimately, what is required is not just to diversify away from a single energy commodity but
to change the energy system itself, and to do so while maintaining the affordable and secure
provision of energy services. The growing impacts of global warming make this all the more
important, as an increasing amount of energy infrastructure that was built for a cooler,
calmer climate is no longer reliable or resilient enough as temperatures rise and weather
events become more extreme. In short, we have to transform the energy system both to
stave off even more severe climate change and to cope with the climate change that is
already with us.

A second difference between the 1970s and today is that we already have the clean energy
technologies for the job in hand. The 1973 oil shock was a major catalyst for change, driving
a huge push to scale up energy efficiency and nuclear power. But it still took many years to
ramp them up while some other key technologies like wind and solar were still emerging.
Today, solar, wind, efficiency and electric cars are all well established and readily available –
and their advantages are only being reinforced by turbulence among the traditional
technologies. We have the lasting solutions to today’s energy dilemmas at our disposal.

The third difference is that clean energy transitions have real momentum at the moment. In
the 1970s, many countries were going from a standing start as they scrambled to respond to
the oil shock. As we show in this WEO, clean energy deployment is moving faster than many
people realise. And it can and should go faster still for us to meet our shared energy and
climate goals. In addition, we have international processes and accords in place today, such
as the Paris Agreement, that provide an important framework for stronger action by
governments.
And one final difference is, unlike in 1973, we have the IEA. I firmly believe that the Agency
has a crucial role to play – by safeguarding against traditional energy security vulnerabilities,
by anticipating new ones, and – in the words of our most recent Ministerial mandates – by
“leading the global energy sector’s fight against climate change”.
The world is much better prepared than we were 50 years ago. We know what we need to
do and where we need to go. At the same time, the challenges are much broader and more
complex – energy security and climate are interwoven, and claiming that we need to focus
on just one or the other is a blinkered view. We can still learn from the response to the oil
shock of 1973 and from the approach that led to the Paris Agreement of 2015: governments
must work together to address our major common challenges because a patchwork of
individual efforts will fall short.
We need to co-ordinate and co-operate – those in the lead and with greater resources need
to help those further behind who have less. Each country must find its own path, but it still
needs some signposts along the way. This WEO highlights, once again, the choices that can
move the energy system in a safer and more sustainable direction. I encourage decision
makers around the world to take this report’s findings into account – in the lead-up to the
COP28 climate change conference in Dubai later this year and beyond.
I would like to commend my IEA colleagues who worked so hard on this WEO – alongside
many other key reports, activities and events – for all their efforts, under the outstanding
leadership of Laura Cozzi and Tim Gould.
We have chosen to dedicate this edition to a longtime friend of the WEO and leading figure
in the history of the IEA, our former Executive Director Mr Robert Priddle, who sadly passed
away in September. After serving as Executive Director between 1994 and 2002, Mr Priddle
continued to make a major contribution for many years as editor of the WEO. In this role, his
deep understanding of energy and geopolitical matters, as well as his exceptional
communication skills, raised our work to a new level. We will miss him greatly.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Executive Summary
The energy world remains fragile but has effective ways to improve energy
security and tackle emissions
Some of the immediate pressures from the global energy crisis have eased, but energy
markets, geopolitics, and the global economy are unsettled and the risk of further
disruption is ever present. Fossil fuel prices are down from their 2022 peaks, but markets
are tense and volatile. Continued fighting in Ukraine, more than a year after Russia’s invasion,
is now accompanied by the risk of protracted conflict in the Middle East. The macroeconomic mood is downbeat, with stubborn inflation, higher borrowing costs and elevated
debt levels. Today, the global average surface temperature is already around 1.2 °C above
pre-industrial levels, prompting heatwaves and other extreme weather events, and
greenhouse gas emissions have not yet peaked. The energy sector is also the primary cause
of the polluted air that more than 90% of the world’s population is forced to breathe, linked
to more than 6 million premature deaths a year. Positive trends on improving access to
electricity and clean cooking have slowed or even reversed in some countries.
Against this complex backdrop, the emergence of a new clean energy economy, led by solar
PV and electric vehicles (EVs), provides hope for the way forward. Investment in clean
energy has risen by 40% since 2020. The push to bring down emissions is a key reason, but
not the only one. The economic case for mature clean energy technologies is strong. Energy
security is also an important factor, particularly in fuel-importing countries, as are industrial
strategies and the desire to create clean energy jobs. Not all clean technologies are thriving
and some supply chains, notably for wind, are under pressure, but there are striking
examples of an accelerating pace of change. In 2020, one in 25 cars sold was electric; in 2023,
this is now one in 5. More than 500 gigawatts (GW) of renewables generation capacity are
set to be added in 2023 – a new record. More than USD 1 billion a day is being spent on solar
deployment. Manufacturing capacity for key components of a clean energy system, including
solar PV modules and EV batteries, is expanding fast. This momentum is why the IEA recently
concluded, in its updated Net Zero Roadmap, that a pathway to limiting global warming to
1.5 °C is very difficult – but remains open.

This new Outlook provides a strong evidence base to guide the choices that face energy
decision makers in pursuit of transitions that are rapid, secure, affordable and inclusive.
The analysis does not present a single view of the future but instead explores different
scenarios that reflect current real-world conditions and starting points. The Stated Policies
Scenario (STEPS) provides an outlook based on the latest policy settings, including energy,
climate and related industrial policies. The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes all
national energy and climate targets made by governments are met in full and on time. Yet,
much additional progress is still required to meet the objectives of the Net Zero Emissions by
2050 (NZE) Scenario which limits global warming to 1.5 °C. Alongside our main scenarios, we
explore some key uncertainties that could affect future trends, including structural changes
in China’s economy and the pace of global deployment of solar PV.

Executive Summary

We are on track to see all fossil fuels peak before 2030
A legacy of the global energy crisis may be to usher in the beginning of the end of the fossil
fuel era: the momentum behind clean energy transitions is now sufficient for global
demand for coal, oil and natural gas to all reach a high point before 2030 in the STEPS. The
share of coal, oil and natural gas in global energy supply – stuck for decades around 80% –
starts to edge downwards and reaches 73% in the STEPS by 2030. This is an important shift.
However, if demand for these fossil fuels remains at a high level, as has been the case for
coal in recent years, and as is the case in the STEPS projections for oil and gas, it is far from
enough to reach global climate goals.
Policies supporting clean energy are delivering as the projected pace of change picks up in
key markets around the world. Thanks largely to the Inflation Reduction Act in the United
States, we now project that 50% of new US car registrations will be electric in 2030 in the
STEPS. Two years ago, the corresponding figure in the WEO-2021 was 12%. In the European
Union in 2030, heat pump installations in the STEPS reach two-thirds of the level needed in
the NZE Scenario, compared with the one-third projected two years ago. In China, projected
additions of solar PV and offshore wind to 2030 are now three-times higher than they were
in the WEO-2021. Prospects for nuclear power have also improved in leading markets, with
support for lifetime extensions of existing nuclear reactors in countries including Japan,
Korea and the United States, as well as for new builds in several more.
Although demand for fossil fuels has been strong in recent years, there are signs of a
change in direction. Alongside the deployment of low-emissions alternatives, the rate at
which new assets that use fossil fuels are being added to the energy system has slowed. Sales
of cars and two/three-wheel vehicles with internal combustion engines are well below where
they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. In the electricity sector, worldwide additions of
coal- and natural gas-fired power plants have halved, at least, from earlier peaks. Sales of
residential gas boilers have been trending downwards and are now outnumbered by sales of
heat pumps in many countries in Europe and in the United States.

China has changed the energy world, but now China is changing

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

China has an outsized role in shaping global energy trends; this influence is evolving as its
economy slows and its structure adjusts, and as clean energy use grows. Over the past ten
years, China accounted for almost two-thirds of the rise in global oil use, nearly one-third of
the increase in natural gas, and has been the dominant player in coal markets. But it is widely
recognised, including by the country’s leadership, that China’s economy is reaching an
inflection point. After a very rapid building out of the country’s physical infrastructure, the
scope for further additions is narrowing. The country already has a world-class high-speed
rail network; and residential floorspace per capita is now equal to that of Japan, even though
GDP per capita is much lower. This saturation points to lower future demand in many energyintensive sectors like cement and steel. China is also a clean energy powerhouse, accounting
for around half of wind and solar additions and well over half of global EV sales in 2022.

18

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Momentum behind China’s economic growth is ebbing and there is greater downside
potential for fossil fuel demand if it slows further. In our scenarios, China’s GDP growth
averages just under 4% per year to 2030. This results in its total energy demand peaking
around the middle of this decade, with robust expansion of clean energy putting overall fossil
fuel demand and emissions into decline. If China’s near-term growth were to slow by another
percentage point, this would reduce 2030 coal demand by an amount almost equal to the
volume currently consumed by the whole of Europe. Oil import volumes would decline by
5% and LNG imports by more than 20%, with major implications for global balances.

New dynamics for investment are taking shape
The end of the growth era for fossil fuels does not mean an end to fossil fuel investment,
but it undercuts the rationale for any increase in spending. Until this year, meeting
projected demand in the STEPS implied an increase in oil and gas investment over the course
of this decade, but a stronger clean energy outlook and lower projected fossil fuel demand
means this is no longer the case. However, investment in oil and gas today is almost double
the level required in the NZE Scenario in 2030, signalling a clear risk of protracted fossil fuel
use that would put the 1.5 °C goal out of reach.
Simply cutting spending on oil and gas will not get the world on track for the NZE Scenario;
the key to an orderly transition is to scale up investment in all aspects of a clean energy
system. The development of a clean energy system and its effect on emissions can be
reinforced by policies that ease the exit of inefficient, polluting assets, such as ageing coal
plants, or that restrict the entry of new ones into the system. But the urgent challenge is to
increase the pace of new clean energy projects, especially in many emerging and developing
economies outside China, where investment in energy transitions needs to rise by more than
five times by 2030 to reach the levels required in the NZE Scenario. A renewed effort,
including stronger international support, will be vital to tackle obstacles such as high costs of
capital, limited fiscal space for government support and challenging business environments.

Meeting development needs in a sustainable way is key to moving faster

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The global peaks in demand for each of the three fossil fuels mask important differences
across economies at different stages of development. The drivers for growth in demand for
energy services in most emerging and developing economies remain very strong. Rates of
urbanisation, built space per capita, and ownership of air conditioners and vehicles are far
lower than in advanced economies. The global population is expected to grow by about 1.7
billion by 2050, almost all of which is added to urban areas in Asia and Africa. India is the
world’s largest source of energy demand growth in the STEPS, ahead of Southeast Asia and
Africa. Finding and financing low-emissions ways to meet rising energy demand in these
economies is a vital determinant of the speed at which global fossil fuel use eventually falls.
Clean electrification, improvements in efficiency and a switch to lower- and zero-carbon
fuels are key levers available to emerging and developing economies to reach their national
energy and climate targets. Getting on track to meet these targets, including net zero goals,
has broad implications for future pathways. In India, it means every dollar of value added by
Executive Summary

19

India’s industry results in 30% less carbon dioxide (CO2) by 2030 than it does today, and each
kilometre driven by a passenger car, on average, emits 25% less CO2. Some 60% of two- and
three-wheelers sold in 2030 are electric, a share ten times higher than today. In Indonesia,
the share of renewables in power generation doubles by 2030 to more than 35%. In Brazil,
biofuels meet 40% of road transport fuel demand by the end of the decade, up from 25%
today. In sub-Saharan Africa, meeting diverse national energy and climate targets means that
85% of new power generation plants to 2030 are based on renewables. Significant progress
is made towards universal access to modern energy, with some 670 million people gaining
access to modern cooking fuels, and 500 million to electricity by 2030.

Ample global manufacturing capacity offers considerable upside for solar PV
Renewables are set to contribute 80% of new power capacity to 2030 in the STEPS, with
solar PV alone accounting for more than half. However, this uses only a fraction of the
world’s potential. Solar has become a major global industry and is set to transform electricity
markets even in the STEPS. But there is significant scope for further growth given
manufacturing plans and the technology’s competitiveness. By the end of the decade, the
world could have manufacturing capacity for more than 1 200 GW of panels per year. But in
the STEPS, only 500 GW is deployed globally in 2030. Boosting deployment up from these
levels raises some complex questions. It would require measures – notably expanding and
strengthening grids and adding storage – to integrate the additional solar PV into electricity
systems and maximise its impact. Manufacturing capacity is also highly concentrated: China
is already the largest producer and its expansion plans far outstrip those in other countries.
Trade, therefore, would continue to be vital to support worldwide deployment of solar.
Using 70% of anticipated solar PV manufacturing capacity would bring deployment to the
levels projected in the NZE Scenario; effectively integrated, this would further cut fossil
fuel use – first and foremost coal. In a sensitivity case, we explore how the STEPS projections
would change if the world added over 800 GW of new solar PV per year by 2030. The
implications would be particularly strong for China, reducing coal-fired generation by a
further 20% by 2030 compared with the STEPS. Without assuming any additional
retirements, the average annual capacity factor for coal-fired power plants would fall to
around 30% in 2030, from over 50% today. The consequences would spread well beyond
China: in this case, more than 70 GW of additional solar PV is deployed on average each year
to 2030 across Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Even with modest
curtailment, this reduces fossil fuel-fired generation in these regions by about one-quarter
in 2030 compared with the STEPS. Solar PV alone cannot get the world on track to meet its
climate goals, but – more than any other clean technology – it can light up the way.

A wave of new LNG export projects is set to remodel gas markets
Starting in 2025, an unprecedented surge in new LNG projects is set to tip the balance of
markets and concerns about natural gas supply. In recent years, gas markets have been
dominated by fears about security and price spikes after Russia cut supplies to Europe.
Market balances remain precarious in the immediate future but that changes from the
middle of the decade. Projects that have started construction or taken final investment
20

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

decision are set to add 250 billion cubic metres per year of liquefaction capacity by 2030,
equal to almost half of today’s global LNG supply. Announced timelines suggest a particularly
large increase between 2025 and 2027. More than half of the new projects are in the United
States and Qatar.
This additional LNG arrives at an uncertain moment for natural gas demand and creates
major difficulties for Russia’s diversification strategy towards Asia. The strong increase in
LNG production capacity eases prices and gas supply concerns, but comes to market at a time
when global gas demand growth has slowed considerably since its “golden age” of the 2010s.
Alongside gas contracted on a longer-term basis to end-users, we estimate that more than
one-third of the new gas will be looking to find buyers on the short-term market. However,
mature markets – notably in Europe – are moving into stronger structural decline and
emerging markets may lack the infrastructure to absorb much larger volumes if gas demand
in China slows. The glut of LNG means there are very limited opportunities for Russia to
secure additional markets. Russia’s share of internationally traded gas, which stood at 30%
in 2021, is halved by 2030 in the STEPS.

Affordability and resilience are watchwords for the future
A tense situation in the Middle East is a reminder of hazards in oil markets a year after
Russia cut gas supplies to Europe. Vigilance on oil and gas security remains essential
throughout clean energy transitions, and our projections highlight how the balance of trade
and potential vulnerabilities shift over time. In the STEPS, the share of seaborne crude oil
trade from the Middle East to Asia rises from some 40% of the total today to 50% by 2050.
Asia is also the final destination for almost all of additional Middle East LNG supply.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The global energy crisis was not a clean energy crisis, but it has focused attention on the
importance of ensuring rapid, people-centred and orderly transitions. Three interlinked
issues stand out: risks to affordability, electricity security and the resilience of clean energy
supply chains. Sheltering consumers from volatile fuel prices in 2022 cost governments
USD 900 billion in emergency support. The way to limit such expenditures in the future is to
deploy cost-effective, clean technologies at scale, especially in poorer households,
communities and countries that struggle to finance the upfront investments required. As the
world moves towards a more electrified, renewables-based system, security of electricity
supply is also paramount. Higher investment in robust and digitalised grids needs to be
accompanied by a role for batteries and demand response measures for short-term flexibility
and lower-emissions technologies for seasonal variations, including hydropower, nuclear,
fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage, bioenergy, hydrogen and ammonia.
Diversification and innovation are the best strategies to manage supply chain
dependencies for clean energy technologies and critical minerals. A range of strategies are
in place to strengthen the resilience of clean energy supply chains and reduce today’s high
levels of concentration, but these will take time to bear fruit. Exploration and production
investments are rising around the world for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel and
rare earths, but the share of the top three producers in 2022 is either unchanged or has
increased from 2019 levels. Our tracking of announced projects suggests concentration levels
Executive Summary

in 2030 are set to remain high, especially for refining and processing operations. Many
midstream projects are being developed in today’s major producing regions, with China
holding half of planned lithium chemical plants and Indonesia representing nearly 90% of
planned nickel refining facilities. Alongside investments in diversified supply, policies
encouraging innovation, mineral substitution and recycling can moderate trends on the
demand side and ease market pressures. They are vital components of critical minerals
security.

We need to go much further and faster, but a fragmented world will not rise
to meet our climate and energy security challenges
Proven policies and technologies are available to align energy security and sustainability
goals, speed up the pace of change this decade and keep the door to 1.5 °C open. The STEPS
sees a peak in energy-related CO2 emissions in the mid-2020s but emissions remain high
enough to push up global average temperatures to around 2.4 °C in 2100. This outcome has
improved over successive editions of the Outlook but still points towards very widespread
and severe impacts from climate change. The key actions required to bend the emissions
curve downwards to 2030 are widely known and in most cases very cost effective. Tripling
renewable energy capacity, doubling the pace of energy efficiency improvements to 4% per
year, ramping up electrification and slashing methane emissions from fossil fuel operations
together provide more than 80% of the emissions reductions needed by 2030 to put the
energy sector on a pathway to limit warming to 1.5 °C. In addition, innovative, large-scale
financing mechanisms are required to support clean energy investments in emerging and
developing economies, as are measures to ensure an orderly decline in the use of fossil fuels,
including an end to new approvals of unabated coal-fired power plants. Every country needs
to find its own pathway, and it needs to be inclusive and equitable to secure public
acceptance, but this package of global measures provides crucial ingredients for any
successful outcome from the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai in December.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

No country is an energy island, and no country is insulated from the risks of climate change.
The necessity of collaboration has never been higher. Especially in today’s tense times,
governments need to find ways to safeguard co-operation on energy and climate, including
by embracing a rules-based system of international trade and spurring innovation and
technology transfer. Without this, the chance to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 °C
will disappear. The outlook for energy security will also look perilous if we lose the benefits
of interconnected and well-functioning energy markets to ride out unexpected shocks.
Fifty years on from the first oil shock, the world has lasting solutions to address energy
insecurity that can also help tackle the climate crisis. The first oil shock 50 years ago brought
two crucial policy responses firmly into play: energy efficiency and low-emissions power, led
at the time by hydropower and nuclear. Today’s energy decision makers are once again
facing geopolitical tensions and the risk of energy shocks, but they have a much broader
range of highly competitive clean technologies at their disposal, and an accumulated wealth
of policy experience on how to accelerate their deployment. The crucial step is to put these
readily available solutions to work.

emissions of shifting to a more sustainable energy system.

• Clean energy projects are facing headwinds in some markets from cost inflation,
supply chain bottlenecks and higher borrowing costs. But clean energy is the most
dynamic aspect of global energy investment. How fast it grows in the coming decades
in response to policy and market stimuli is key to explain the differences in trajectories
and outcomes across our three main scenarios. In all scenarios, the momentum
behind the clean energy economy is enough to produce a peak in demand for coal, oil
and natural gas this decade, although the rates of post-peak decline vary widely.

• In the Stated Policies Scenario, average annual growth rate of 0.7% in total energy
demand to 2030 is around half the rate of energy demand growth of the last decade.
Demand continues to increase through to 2050. In the Announced Pledges Scenario,
total energy demand flattens, thanks to improved efficiency and the inherent
efficiency advantages of technologies powered by electricity – such as electric
vehicles and heat pumps – over fossil fuel-based alternatives. In the Net Zero
Emissions by 2050 Scenario, electrification and efficiency gains proceed even faster,
leading to a decline in primary energy of 1.2% per year to 2030.

• Our analysis explores some key uncertainties, notably regarding the pace of China’s
economic growth and the possibilities for more rapid solar PV deployment opened by
a massive planned expansion in manufacturing capacity (led by China). We highlight
the implications of a huge increase in the capacity to export liquefied natural gas
starting in the middle of this decade, led by the United States and Qatar. We examine
how any deterioration in geopolitical tensions would undermine both the prospects
for energy security and for rapid, affordable transitions.

• Extreme volatility in energy markets during the global energy crisis has highlighted
the importance of affordable, reliable and resilient supply, especially in price-sensitive

Introduction
Some of the tensions in energy markets receded in 2023 since the extreme volatility of the
global energy crisis, but the situation remains fragile. The urgent task of transforming the
energy system now takes place in a more challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical
context. The frailties of the fossil fuel age and the hazards that it has created for the planet
are plain to see, and opportunities in the emerging clean energy economy are growing fast.
But many uncertainties remain about the resilience of energy supply chains old and new,
about risks to the security and affordability of transitions, and about whether the process of
change will be sufficiently rapid to avoid very severe impacts from a changing climate.
Using the latest data for energy markets, policies and technologies, the World Energy Outlook
(WEO) provides insights on all these key issues. It does so by exploring scenarios that reflect
different assumptions about the actions taken in the coming years to shape energy systems
and reduce energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The projections in the Stated
Policies Scenario (STEPS) give a sense of the current direction of travel for the energy
economy, based on the actual state of play in different sectors, countries and regions. The
Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) shows how that future would be different if all countries
were to hit their aspirational targets, including national and regional net zero emissions
pledges, on time and in full. The updated Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario
illustrates what more is required to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius (°C).
This overview chapter provides ten takeaways from the new analysis. Our projections show
that for the first time demand for each of the fossil fuels reach a peak in the STEPS before
the end of this decade. We examine how uncertainties over the pace of economic growth in
The People’s Republic of China (hereinafter China) could affect the near-term outlook, as
well as the implications of the extraordinary China-led boom in manufacturing capacity for
solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. We highlight areas of hope and areas for caution about the
prospects of staying within the 1.5 °C limit, and examine the crucial issue of capital flows for
clean energy and fossil fuels.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Against a background of macroeconomic uncertainty, we consider the affordability of the
transition for households, industry and governments. As the world comes to rely more and
more on electricity, we look at risks affecting technologies that have a key part to play in
increasing electrification and decarbonising the power supply. We also ask whether the
policy and technology choices facing emerging market and developing economies open the
possibility of a new lower carbon pathway for development. In addition, we identify the ways
in which geopolitical tensions could affect the Outlook, and look back to see how and why
our projections have changed over time.
The topics included in this chapter represent key themes of the World Energy Outlook 2023.
Further information and background on the IEA Net Zero Roadmap is in Net Zero Roadmap:
A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 °C Goal in Reach published in September 2023. In addition,
a range of supply and demand issues for the oil and gas industry and their relation to the
Outlook are the focus of a forthcoming special report in November 2023.

1.1

A peak by 2030 for each of the fossil fuels

In the WEO-2023, the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) sees lower demand projections for
each of the fossil fuels than in the WEO-2022. This reflects current policy settings by
governments worldwide, a slight downward revision in the economic outlook, and the
continued ramifications of the 2022 global energy crisis. It also reflects longer term trends:
fossil fuel technologies have been losing market share to clean energy technologies across
various sectors in recent years, and in many cases fossil fuel-powered technologies have
already seen a peak in sales or additions.
These shifts mean that each of the three fossil fuel categories are now projected to reach a
peak by 2030 (Figure 1.1). This has never previously been seen in the STEPS. The changes in
our projections highlight how the energy system is changing as low-emissions electricity and
fuels meet an increasing share of the world’s rising energy needs, and as energy efficiency
improvements help to moderate those needs. Total demand for fossil fuels declines from the
mid-2020s by an average of 3 exajoules (EJ) per year to 2050 in the STEPS, and the peak in
energy-related CO2 emissions in the STEPS is brought forward to the mid-2020s.

All fossil fuels peak before the end of this decade, with declines in
advanced economies and China offsetting increasing demand elsewhere

We highlight below some of the key drivers for these changes by fuel, but there are some
important issues to bear in mind when considering these trends. First, the projected declines
in demand after the peaks are nowhere near steep enough to be consistent with the
NZE Scenario – getting on track for this scenario will require much faster clean energy
deployment and much more determined policy action by governments (section 1.4). Second,
the demand trends for the different fuels vary considerably among regions, with reduced
26

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

demand in advanced economies partially offset by continued growth in many emerging
market and developing economies, particularly for natural gas. Third, while the trajectories
in our scenarios reflect underlying structural changes, the demand outlook will not be linear
in practice. There will inevitably be spikes, dips and plateaus along the way. For example,
heatwaves and droughts could well cause temporary jumps in coal demand by pushing up
electricity use at a time when hydropower output may be constrained.
Even as demand for fossil fuels falls, energy security challenges will remain since the process
of adjustment to changing demand patterns will not necessarily be easy or smooth. For
example, the peaks in demand we see based on today’s policies do not remove the need for
investment in oil and gas supply, given how steep the natural declines from existing fields
often are. At the same time, they underline the economic and financial risks of major new oil
and gas projects, on top of their risks for climate change (section 1.5).

1.1.1

Coal: Scaling up clean power hastens the decline

After remaining consistently high over the past decade, global coal demand is now set to fall
within the next few years in the STEPS (Figure 1.2). This projected trend reflects declines in
recent years of capacity additions of both coal-fired power and coal-fired iron and steel
production – the two largest consumers of coal today – which account for 65% and 16%
respectively of overall coal consumption.

The share of coal-fired power in new worldwide capacity additions hit a high point in 2006
at 45% and has since fallen steadily to 11% in 2022. The size of annual coal capacity additions
peaked in 2012 at over 100 gigawatts (GW) before dropping to 50 GW in 2022, with big
investments in coal falling away rapidly, and solar PV and wind power increasingly
dominating the expansion of electricity systems. The role of coal-fired power plants has
started to shift towards providing flexibility and system services rather than bulk power. As
a result, the average capacity factor of coal power plants was almost ten percentage points
lower over the past decade than during the decade before.
Changes in iron and steel production have also contributed to the decline in coal demand.
Capacity additions of coal-based steel production plants 1 peaked in 2003 at over 130 million
tonnes (Mt), driven in large part by China’s rapid industrialisation. Eleven years later, global
coal demand for iron and steel production peaked at over 950 million tonnes of coal
equivalent (Mtce) before starting to fall, despite a continuing steady increase in the
production of iron and steel. The decline in the global coal intensity of steel production since
2015 is the result of growth in the share of scrap-based production in electric arc furnaces,
as well as alternatives to blast furnaces for iron production such as natural gas-based direct
reduced iron.
In advanced economies, coal demand peaked in 2007. In China – the world’s largest coal
consumer – the impressive growth of renewables and nuclear alongside macroeconomic
shifts point to a decrease in coal use by the mid-2020s. Coal use continues to increase in
other emerging market and developing economies as new power plants and industry
capacity come online, but this growth is more than offset by projected declines elsewhere.

1.1.2

Oil: End of the “ICE age” turns prospects around

In the past two decades, oil demand has surged by 18 million barrels per day (mb/d). Much
of the increase has been driven by rising demand in road transport. The global car fleet
expanded by more than 600 million cars over the last 20 years, and road freight activity has
increased by almost 65%. Road transport now accounts for around 45% of global oil demand,
which is far more than any other sector: the petrochemicals sector, second-largest in oil
consumption, accounts for 15% of oil demand.

The astounding rise in electric vehicle (EV) sales is now having an impact on demand for oil
in road transport. Sales of gasoline and diesel cars, two/three-wheelers and trucks peaked in
2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively (Figure 1.3). In 2020, EVs accounted for 4% of global car
sales. They are on track to reach 18% in 2023 with 14 million EV sales, mostly in China and
the advanced economies, and are set to continue to increase rapidly in the future. Sales of
internal combustion engine (ICE) buses also peak by the mid-2020s in the STEPS, with the
uptake of electric buses rising particularly quickly in emerging market and developing
economies. By the end of this decade, road transport is no longer a source of oil demand
growth.

Sales of gasoline and diesel passenger vehicles and trucks have already peaked,

Note: mb/d = million barrels per day; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing

Although oil demand for petrochemicals, aviation and shipping continues to increase through
to 2050 in the STEPS, this is not enough to offset reductions in demand from road transport,
as well as in the power and buildings sectors. As a result, oil demand peaks before 2030. The
decline from the peak however is a slow one in the STEPS all the way through to 2050.
The outlook for oil demand varies across regions. Oil demand in advanced economies peaked
in 2005, and its decline becomes more pronounced in the coming decade. China’s robust oil
demand growth since 2010 weakens in the coming years and declines in the long run. In
emerging market and developing economies (other than China), which see growing
populations and car ownership, oil demand grows continuously to 2050.

Natural gas: Energy crisis marks the end of the “Golden Age”

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The “Golden Age of Gas”, a term coined by the IEA in 2011, is nearing an end. Global natural
gas use has increased by an annual average of almost 2% since 2011, but growth slows in the
STEPS to less than 0.4% per year from now until 2030. The power and buildings sectors –
today’s biggest consumers of natural gas accounting for 39% and 21% respectively of total
demand – have already seen peaks in natural gas capacity additions for power plants and
space heating boilers, and muted demand in these two sectors reduces natural gas use
enough to cause it to peak by 2030 (Figure 1.4).

Additions of new gas power plants and gas boilers in buildings are slowing; gas demand
peaks before 2030 in the STEPS, though gas use in industry continues to increase
Note: bcm = billion cubic metres; AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing
economies.

The high point for natural gas power capacity additions was in 2002, when they exceeded
100 GW and made up around 65% of total annual capacity additions. Capacity additions fell
to less than 30 GW in 2022. Despite this slowing in annual additions, the global installed
capacity of natural gas power continues to expand over time. Gas differs in this respect from
coal, where installed capacity reduces in the future. Natural gas demand in the power sector
nevertheless declines in the STEPS from today until 2050, with a particularly strong dip in the
2030s when co-firing in gas-fired power plants begins to be deployed at scale.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Sales of gas-fired boilers for space heating in buildings have also peaked. At their height, gas
boilers accounted for around 40% of total sales of space heating equipment. The subsequent
decline in sales over the last few years reflects the rapid rise of heat pumps, especially in
advanced economies. Heat pump sales have a strong impact on gas demand in the buildings
sector in the STEPS trajectory because space heating is by far the leading end-use in terms of
natural gas demand today.
In advanced economies, the rebound in natural gas demand seen in 2021 did not last long,
and demand in 2022 was below pre-pandemic levels. This faltering in demand reflects a shift
to renewables in electricity generation, the rise of heat pumps, and Europe’s accelerated
move away from gas following the Russian Federation (hereinafter Russia) invasion of
Ukraine. Demand continues to decline in the STEPS, and by 2030 this more than offsets
continued demand growth in emerging market and developing economies.

A slowdown in economic growth in China would have
huge implications for energy markets

1.2.1

China’s growth has defined the energy world in recent decades

China’s economic growth has been an epoch-making event over the last several decades.
Since 1995, China accounted for two-thirds of the decline in the global population living in
extreme poverty. Its GDP per capita increased more than seven-times in the same period, as
its economy transformed into a globally integrated, innovative industrial powerhouse.

More recently, over the course of the last decade China was responsible for more than onethird of growth in global GDP (Figure 1.5). China’s growth has done much to shape energy
markets and the global environment: in the last decade, it accounted for more than 50% of
global energy demand growth and 85% of the rise in energy sector CO2 emissions. But its
economy is changing. China’s leaders have long acknowledged that its current phase of
massive and resource-intensive investment in urbanisation, infrastructure and factories must
end. As far back as 2007, China’s then Premier warned that "the biggest problem with China's
economy is that growth is unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable". This
rebalancing could have substantial impacts on the outlook for China’s energy sector, and
given China’s size, for the world too.

1.2.2

Integrating a slowdown in China’s economy into the STEPS

The rebalancing of the Chinese economy still has a long way to go. Savings and investment
levels remain very high, the debt-to-GDP ratio has continued to climb, and the construction
sector retains an outsized role in GDP (Figure 1.6). This model is pushing against inherent
constraints. China already has a world-class infrastructure stock, and after growing almost
30% in the last decade its per capita residential floorspace is already equal to that of Japan,
despite China’s lower level of GDP per capita. China’s working age population peaked around
2015 and is projected to fall by more than 20% by 2050. With this will come a reduced need
for investment, such as in new housing and infrastructure (Figure 1.7).

Although the current property crisis in China has attracted much attention, it has not yet
significantly impacted the energy sector (Box 1.1). Moreover, the property crisis is a
symptom of the broad structural change facing the Chinese economy. How this economic
transition plays out is one of the key uncertainties in this Outlook. In our scenarios, we have
revised downwards the long-term projection of GDP growth in China to just under 4% per
year for the period 2022 to 2030, and 2.3% per year for the period 2031 to 2050. This
compares to more than 4.5% and more than 2.5% respectively in the World Energy Outlook2022 scenarios. As a result, the economy is around 5% smaller in 2030 than projected last

year, and slightly less than 15% smaller in 2050. Despite these changes, China remains a
critical driver of global growth, accounting for almost one-third of global GDP growth to 2030
in our scenarios. But slower growth results in China’s total energy demand peaking around
the middle of this decade; with stable and then slowly declining demand, clean energy
growth is sufficient to drive a decline in fossil fuel demand and hence emissions.

The property crisis is everywhere, except in the energy statistics

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Despite the importance of the unfolding property crisis, China’s energy demand and its
heavy industrial production appear only modestly affected. The total floorspace of new
projects started per year fell around 50% from 2019 to 2022; but floorspace under
construction, despite falling in 2022, is still 1% higher than in 2019 (Figure 1.8). In other
words, the property crisis has impacted new projects, not those already under
construction. This explains why material and energy demand has been less impacted than
indicators like new project starts or property developer share or bond prices. It also
implies that if China’s property sector settles into a lower level of activity, over time this
will impact the stock of projects under construction and hence energy and material
demand underlying construction projects.

There are several additional reasons, both structural and cyclical, which explain why
energy demand has been resilient in the face of the downturn in the property sector in
China:


Rapid electrification has driven strong electricity demand growth. Electricity
generation accounted for more than 70% of the increase in energy demand since
2015 in China.



“New economy” sectors have been growing strongly, including high-tech
manufacturing in clean energy areas such as PV and EVs. While the average annual
growth of fixed asset investment in property has shrunk by around 5% since January
2022, it has grown by about 15% for automobile manufacturing, for example. To take
another example, revenue in the last year for listed solar PV manufacturers and
automobile manufacturers amounted to USD 166 billion and USD 135 billion
respectively.



China is massively increasing its domestic petrochemical production. Between 2019
and 2024, China is set to add as much petrochemical capacity as the combined
capacity of all OECD countries in Europe and Asia. Feedstock demand for
petrochemical production has increased 50% since 2019 and is responsible for
around 80% of growth in oil product demand in China over the 2019 to 2023 period.



Droughts in 2021 and 2022 constrained hydro electricity production (and are
continuing to do so in 2023). Without this factor, China’s total energy demand
growth would have been less in 2022, and its CO2 emissions would have declined
rather than risen marginally.

34

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

1.2.3

Sensitivities in the Outlook

But outcomes other than those in the STEPS are possible. To explore possible implications,
we have modelled a Low Case and a High Case. In the Low Case, China’s GDP is around 7.5%
lower in 2030 than in the STEPS, with a more rapid decline in infrastructure and property
investment not fully offset by an increase in consumption and investment in other sectors.
Cement production is around 14% lower than in the STEPS, for example. The Low Case
assumes slower but ultimately “higher quality” growth. 2 The High Case assumes the reverse,
with a delayed rebalancing temporarily increasing GDP growth while at the same time
negatively impacting longer term economic sustainability.

Slower but high quality growth in this decade would have large
impacts on world energy markets and China’s CO2 emissions

In the Low Case, primary coal demand is around 7% lower than in the STEPS in 2030 due to
lower levels of production in heavy industries, less electricity demand, and continued robust
expansion of low-emissions sources of electricity generation (Figure 1.9). Oil is less affected
than coal, with primary demand around 0.75 mb/d lower than in the STEPS, but the decline
in demand nevertheless represents the equivalent of about 5% in projected 2030 oil imports
in the STEPS (or about 2% of the global market). Natural gas is also less affected than coal,
with demand almost 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) lower in 2030 than in the STEPS, though
still over 15% higher than in 2022. This reduction represents the equivalent of more than

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

2 Increasingly used in official discourse, the phrase “high quality” growth is taken to mean economic growth

based on domestic consumption, external demand and business investment in productive sectors, as opposed
to continued growth based on high investment in property and infrastructure with low and diminishing
productivity returns.

20% of China’s projected liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in the STEPS in 2030. These
various changes result in CO2 emissions that are more than 0.8 gigatonnes (Gt) lower in 2030
than in the STEPS, and nearly 15% lower than in 2022. On the other hand, the High Case sees
stronger coal demand and higher CO2 emissions. Emissions still peak before 2030, but in 2030
are about 0.8 Gt higher than in the STEPS, and 1.6 Gt higher than in the Low Case. As in the
Low Case, the impact across fuels is not symmetrical, with less of an upside for oil than for
coal. In both the High Case and the Low Case, the weight of China in global energy markets
means that the changes have significant global implications.
This discussion highlights the importance of paying close attention to China’s
macroeconomic evolution. The Low Case, predicated on lower but higher quality growth,
would have substantial and probably deflationary impacts on global energy commodity and
technology markets. At the same time, increased emphasis on export-oriented sectors,
including clean energy technology sectors, in order to partially offset the decline of others
such as property could have implications for – already strained – trade relations. On the other
hand, a prolongation of the current infrastructure and property intensive model might
provide a near-term boost to energy and commodity markets, but it would also increase CO2
emissions and could store economic problems for the future.

1.3

A boom of solar manufacturing could be a boon for
the world

Solar manufacturing has experienced a remarkable expansion over the last decade,
increasing ten-fold globally to meet increasing demand for clean energy. This trend is set to
continue at an elevated pace, with investments in the pipeline set to raise global solar
module manufacturing capacity from about 640 GW in 2022 to over 1 200 GW in the medium
term (Figure 1.10). Paired with rapid expansion along the supply chain – from the production
of polysilicon to wafers and solar cells – solar PV is poised to accelerate clean energy
transitions around the world.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Solar PV has been one of the major successes of the past decade, with annual deployment
of electricity generation capacity growing more than sevenfold. Manufacturing capacity
expansion has been even faster and the gap has driven down the utilisation rate of solar
manufacturing from close to 60% to below 40% in 2022. This is well below the 70% level that
would normally be considered healthy for a mature industry. In the STEPS, global solar PV
deployment continues to expand from around 220 GW in 2022 to about 500 GW in 2030, but
planned manufacturing expansion means that the utilisation rate of solar manufacturing
remains below 40% through to 2030. The scope to make fuller use of solar manufacturing
capacity represents an enormous opportunity to accelerate the deployment of solar PV
around the world and accelerate energy transitions.

1.3.1

Solar module manufacturing and trade

Solar manufacturing today is highly concentrated – just five countries account for over 90%
of global capacity. China is far and away the largest, with the capacity to produce solar
modules with an output of over 500 GW every year, equivalent to 80% of world
manufacturing capacity. The other four are Viet Nam (5% of the global market), India (3%),
Malaysia (3%) and Thailand (2%). The next five leading solar manufacturers – the United
States, Korea, Cambodia, Türkiye and Chinese Taipei – each account for around 1% of the
global total, as does the European Union.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

While fewer than 40 countries have capacity to produce solar modules, over 100 countries
completed solar PV projects in 2022, which mostly relied on imported solar panels. China is
the primary exporter of solar panels (IEA, 2022a). Its exports, and those of other exporters,
facilitate the expansion of renewable energy in markets around the world. Southeast Asia is
the second-largest exporter, with many of the panels it exports going to the United States
and the European Union. As domestic manufacturing capacity in India has increased in recent
years, there is potential to reduce import dependence over the coming years. Today, the
European Union and the United States are the largest importers of solar panels. New import
tariffs have recently been put in place in the United States on solar modules that originate in
China: these are set to change the pattern of imports to the United States, and may have
knock-on effects in other markets.

Solar manufacturing is set to expand in more than a dozen countries: China remains the
largest exporter, while the European Union and United States remain the main importers

Plans for additional capacity suggest that solar manufacturing will remain highly
concentrated, and that trade will continue to be important for many markets (Figure 1.11).
China plans to add another 500 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity in the coming
years, far outstripping plans for new capacity in other countries. Expansion on this scale
means that it is likely to maintain its 80% share of the global total and to remain the primary
exporter of solar modules by some distance. India aims to continue expanding its production
capacity to meet domestic needs and to export solar modules: projects in the pipeline under
the Production Linked Incentives scheme suggest that its manufacturing capacity could
exceed 70 GW per year by 2027. Production capacity in Southeast Asia is set to outpace
regional needs, allowing it to remain an important exporter. In the United States, planned
solar module production capacity investments have been boosted by the Inflation Reduction
Act, and are on course to increase sixfold in the medium term. However, without further
investment, significant imports will still be needed to meet fast growing solar PV deployment
in the STEPS in 2030. Solar manufacturing in the European Union is set to double in the
medium term, but here too deployment is increasing rapidly, and about 70% of deployment
in 2030 will depend on imported solar modules unless further investments are made in
manufacturing in the European Union.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

1.3.2

Solar PV deployment could scale up faster to accelerate transitions

Planned increases in solar PV manufacturing capacity around the world have the potential to
enable over 800 GW of new solar PV to be deployed in 2030, which is in line with the level of
deployment reached in the NZE Scenario in 2030 (Figure 1.12). This would raise the average
38

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

utilisation rate for solar module manufacturing to around 70%, which is roughly what might
be expected in a mature industry. We have constructed the NZE Solar Case which looks at
what would happen if all this potential solar capacity was tapped and compares the
outcomes in 2030 with those in the STEPS. The rest of this section highlights this comparison.

Taking advantage of solar manufacturing capacity could lift solar PV deployment to over
800 GW by 2030, in line with the NZE Scenario, cutting power sector emissions 30% by 2030
Note: GW = gigawatts; Gt = gigatonnes; NZE solar = NZE Solar Case.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

An important initial point is that rapid further deployment of solar PV in the NZE Solar Case
would require measures to integrate the additional solar PV into electricity systems and
maximise its impact. Scaling up battery storage would be crucial in most cases to improve
the alignment of solar PV output with electricity demand patterns and system needs. In the
NZE Solar Case, utility-scale battery deployment in 2030 is close to double the level in the
STEPS. Measures to modernise and expand networks, facilitate demand response and boost
power system flexibility would also be necessary.
Accelerating solar PV deployment to the levels in the NZE Scenario would reduce CO2
emissions in 2030 by displacing some unabated fossil fuels. Global CO2 emissions from the
power sector would fall below 11 Gt in 2030, some 15% lower than the level in the STEPS in
2030 and 30% below the level in 2022. Coal-fired electricity generation would be around 15%
lower than in the STEPS in 2030: the decline in coal-fired generation would largely take place
in emerging market and developing economies and would deliver the bulk of the emissions
reductions. Natural gas-fired electricity generation would also be reduced by 15% compared
with the STEPS in 2030, with reductions in both advanced economies and emerging market
and developing economies.

China could accelerate solar PV deployment to shift away from coal faster
In the STEPS, solar PV capacity additions in China reach over 270 GW per year before
flattening. While this means a marked slowing of the rate of growth achieved in recent years,
it still puts China five years ahead of schedule to reach 1 200 GW of solar PV and wind
capacity, which is one of the targets for 2030 in its Nationally Determined Contribution.
Nevertheless, there is scope for China to accelerate its uptake of both distributed solar PV
and large-scale projects. In the NZE Solar Case, China’s annual solar PV capacity additions
exceed 400 GW by 2030 (Figure 1.13). To successfully integrate the additional solar PV and
keep curtailment at manageable levels, battery storage and network enhancements would
be as important in China as everywhere else. Continued progress on power system reforms,
including further moves towards a unified national power market, would help make the best
use of the additional solar PV (IEA, 2023a).

With targeted integration measures, China could deploy significantly
more solar PV and put coal-fired power into a steeper decline

Effectively integrated, higher solar PV deployment would accelerate the transition away from
coal-fired power in China. While coal-fired generation would still peak around 2025, it would
decline more steeply afterwards. By 2030, the level of coal-fired generation in the NZE Solar
Case would be 20% lower than in the STEPS and 35% lower than in 2022. Without assuming
any additional retirements, the average annual capacity factor for coal-fired power plants
would fall to about 30% in 2030, compared with about 40% in the STEPS and over 50% in
2022. As a result, power sector CO2 emissions would fall to about 4.2 Gt in 2030, a 30%
reduction from the 2022 level.

40

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Emerging market and developing economies could also shift away from coal faster
Spare solar PV manufacturing capacity could also facilitate faster uptake of low cost solar PV
in emerging market and developing economies other than China. In the NZE Solar Case, more
than 70 GW of additional solar PV is deployed each year to 2030 across Africa, Latin America
and the Caribbean (LAC), Middle East and Southeast Asia. Even with modest amounts of
curtailment, this would reduce both natural gas-fired and coal-fired power generation by
about one-quarter in 2030 compared with the levels in the STEPS, cutting power sector CO2
emissions in 2030 by over 500 Mt, 30% of the total. The Middle East would also have the
opportunity to cut both coal and natural gas use in power, while in LAC the additional solar
PV would mostly reduce demand for natural gas-fired generation; in Africa and Southeast
Asia, its biggest impact would be on coal-fired power (Figure 1.14).

Hydropower resources in LAC and Africa could facilitate the integration of more solar PV,
while the Middle East’s reliance on natural gas would also help to provide system flexibility.
Southeast Asia would face the most serious integration challenges, which could be eased by
expanding interconnections and cross-border trade (IEA, 2019). In all emerging market and
developing economies, access to finance and the reduced costs of capital would be essential
to be able to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate uptake of solar PV (IEA, 2021a).

The pathway to a 1.5 °C limit on global warming
is very tough, but it remains open

Net Zero Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 °C Goal in Reach, the IEA update to the
landmark Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap, was published in September 2023 (IEA, 2023b). The
updated Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario is incorporated in full in this Outlook. It
reached the conclusion that the pathway to net zero emissions by 2050 has narrowed since
the first version published in 2021, but that it remains feasible. In this section, we highlight
four reasons why this pathway remains open and look at four areas that require urgent
attention if the promise of a 1.5 °C limit on global warming is to be realised.

1.4.1

Four reasons for hope

Clean energy policies are stepping up
Many countries and an increasing number of businesses are committed to reaching net zero
emissions. As of September 2023, net zero emissions pledges cover more than 85% of global
energy-related emissions and nearly 90% of global GDP. Ninety-three countries and the
European Union have pledged to meet a net zero emissions target. Moreover, governments
around the world, especially in advanced economies, have responded to the pandemic and
the global energy crisis by putting forward new measures designed to promote the uptake
of renewables, electric cars, heat pumps, energy efficiency and other clean energy
technologies.
EV targets have driven a major transformation in the industrial strategies of car and truck
manufacturers in recent years, together with fuel economy and CO2 emissions standards in
the European Union and China, and more recently in the United States. Similarly, electric
two/three-wheelers and buses have seen significant uptake in India and other emerging
market and developing economies thanks to policy support, increasing economic
competitiveness and limited infrastructure needs. The United States, through the Inflation
Reduction Act adopted in 2022, has provided unprecedented funding to support deployment
and reduce costs for a range of low-emissions technologies, notably carbon capture,
utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen. Successive five-year plans in China have
progressively raised ambitions for solar PV and driven down global costs. Offshore wind
deployment in Europe has turned into a global industry.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Clean energy deployment is accelerating fast
Clean energy investment and deployment have increased rapidly in response to the market
signals and financial incentives provided by governments, with mass-manufactured
technologies such as solar PV, wind turbines and EVs leading the way. Sales of residential
heat pumps and stationary battery storage are also rising fast. Since the Paris Agreement was
signed in 2015, almost 1 terawatt (TW) of solar PV capacity has been added to the global
system – nearly equivalent to the total installed electricity capacity in the European Union.

42

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Around 40% of this deployment was in 2021 and 2022. Well over half of the electric cars on
the road worldwide have been sold since 2021.
As a result, solar PV capacity additions are currently tracking ahead of the trajectory
envisaged in the 2021 version of our NZE Scenario. We now estimate that global
manufacturing capacities for solar PV and EV batteries would be sufficient to meet projected
demand in 2030 in the updated NZE Scenario, if all announced projects proceed. This
progress reflects major cost reductions in recent years: the costs of key clean energy
technologies – solar PV, wind, heat pumps and batteries – fell by close to 80% on a
deployment weighted average basis between 2010 and 2022.
Box 1.2 ⊳

Clean energy deployment is starting to bend the emissions curve

Clean energy deployment is starting to bend the emissions curve, thanks largely to solar
PV, wind power and EVs. These three technologies contribute the bulk of the emissions
reductions in the WEO-2023 STEPS relative to a pre-Paris Baseline Scenario (Figure 1.15).
Solar PV is projected to reduce emissions by around 3 Gt in 2030, roughly equivalent to
the emissions from all the cars on the road worldwide today. Wind power is projected to
reduce emissions by around a further 2 Gt in 2030, and EVs by around 1 Gt more. This is
far from enough to get on track for net zero emissions by 2050; indeed staying on a STEPS
trajectory to 2030 would definitely close the door to the 1.5 °C limit. But it is keeping the
pathway open.

We have the tools to go much faster
The key actions required to bend the emissions curve much more sharply downwards by
2030 are mature, tried and tested, and in most cases very cost effective. More than 80% of
the additional emissions reductions needed in 2030 in the NZE Scenario come from wellknown sources: ramping up renewables, improving energy efficiency, increasing
electrification and cutting methane emissions. In the NZE Scenario, tripling the installed
capacity of renewables and doubling the rate of energy intensity improvements are central
to the transformation of the energy sector.

Renewables, energy efficiency and methane emissions reduction options
are available today and crucial to reducing near-term emissions

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Tripling global installed capacity of renewables to 11 000 GW by 2030 provides the largest
emissions reductions to 2030 in the NZE Scenario. Current trends are encouraging; repeating
the growth rate seen over the last decade would be sufficient, and current policy settings
already put advanced economies and China on track to achieve 85% of their contribution to
this global goal. The contribution of solar PV has been revised upward from the 2021 version
of the NZE Scenario, underpinned by a surge in global manufacturing capacity, but a range of
low-emissions technologies is required to ensure balanced and secure decarbonisation of the
power sector.
Doubling the annual rate of energy intensity improvement by 2030 in the NZE Scenario not
only reduces emissions but also boosts energy security and affordability, saving the energy
equivalent of all worldwide oil use in road transport today. Priorities vary by country, but the
44

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

key improvements at the global level come from upgrading the technical efficiency of
equipment such as electric motors and air conditioners, from efficiency gains brought about
by electrification and the switch away from solid biomass use in low income countries, and
from using energy and materials more efficiently.
Further electrification of end-uses is a priority. EVs and heat pumps are central to this. Sales
of EVs are already increasing fast enough to achieve the NZE Scenario milestone of two-outof-three cars sold in 2030 being electric, and announced production targets from car makers
suggest that such an outcome is within reach. Heat pump sales rose 11% globally in 2022,
but many markets, notably in the European Union, are already tracking ahead of the roughly
20% annual growth rate needed to 2030 in the NZE Scenario.
Achieving the rapid growth in renewables, efficiency and electrification envisaged in the
NZE Scenario drives down demand for fossil fuels by more than 25% this decade. However,
it is also vital to reduce emissions from the fossil fuels that continue to be used. Cutting
methane emissions from fossil fuel supply by 75% by 2030 is one of the lowest cost
opportunities to limit warming in the near term, and the technical solutions needed are tried
and tested. Without action to reduce methane emissions from fossil fuel supply, global
energy sector CO2 emissions would need to reach net zero by around 2045 to meet the 1.5 °C
limit goal.

The world is finding innovative answers
There is noticeably less reliance on early-stage technologies to reach net zero emissions in
the updated NZE Scenario than in our first roadmap report in 2021. At that time, technologies
not available on the market, i.e. at prototype or demonstration phase, delivered nearly 50%
of the emissions reductions needed in 2050 to reach net zero. Now that number is around
35% (Figure 1.17). Progress has been driven by both public and private efforts to further
develop and commercialise new clean energy technologies, spurred by supportive
government policies and the growing market prize of the clean energy economy. Energy
R&D spending by globally listed companies exceeded USD 130 billion in 2022, an increase of
25% from 2020, and clean energy venture capital flows remain strong, despite the more
difficult macroeconomic environment.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Part of this shift is also due to increased confidence in direct electrification as a cost-effective
approach. In the road transport sector, for example, cost reductions and standardisation for
commercial lithium-ion batteries in particular have strengthened the business case for
electromobility over other options for all types of road transport. Overall, the
decarbonisation of road transport in the 2023 NZE Scenario relies around ten percentage
points less on technologies under development in 2050 than was the case in the 2021
version, in part because of a reduction in the share of hydrogen fuel cell electric heavy-duty
vehicles.

1.4.2

Four areas requiring urgent attention

Scale up clean energy investment in emerging market and developing economies
Clean energy investment needs to rise everywhere, but the steepest increases are needed in
emerging market and developing economies other than China (Figure 1.18). From 2015 to
2022, advanced economies and China together accounted for over 95% of global electric car
and heat pump sales and nearly 85% of combined wind and solar capacity additions. There
are some bright spots elsewhere, notably solar investment in India, but overall clean energy
investment outside advanced economies and China has been stagnant in real terms since
2015. It would need to increase by more than six-times over the next ten years to get on
track for the NZE Scenario. However, there are significant obstacles to such a scale-up,
including tightening financial and fiscal conditions, high levels of government indebtedness,
and high cost of capital for clean energy projects. Overcoming these will require stronger
domestic policies together with enhanced international support, including much more
concessional funding to improve risk adjusted returns and mobilise private capital at scale.
Demand for energy services to 2050 is set to rise fastest in emerging market and developing
economies other than China, and it is vital that this increased demand is met in a sustainable
way. At the moment, the distribution of clean energy use across countries is even more
unequal than for energy consumption as a whole. Among the countries for which IEA has
comprehensive energy statistics, the current Gini coefficient 3 of energy inequality is 0.39 for

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

3 The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality typically used to measure income inequality, which has been

adopted in this section to evaluate inequality in energy consumption. 1 indicates perfect inequality (where
one group or one individual consumes or receives all the resources), while 0 indicates perfect equality.

all sources of energy consumption and 0.46 for clean energy. This underlines the need to find
ways to improve investment in emerging market and developing countries other than China,
and to raise the level of deployment of clean energy technologies in those countries.

Note: MER = market exchange rate; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

Ensure a balanced mix of investment, especially in infrastructure

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

A net zero energy system cannot rely only on solar, wind power and EVs. Rapid growth in the
use of these technologies needs to be complemented by larger, smarter and repurposed
infrastructure networks, large quantities of low-emissions fuels, and technologies to capture
CO2 and store it permanently or transform it into climate neutral fuels. Investments in many
of these areas are lagging. Grid infrastructure is a case in point: the time required to obtain
grid connections can take several years and appears to be increasing rather than shrinking.
This is hindering current projects and risks choking off new ones. In the NZE Scenario,
transmission and distribution grids expand by around 2 million kilometres (km) each year to
2030, and around 30 000 to 50 000 km of CO2 pipelines are installed by the same year,
together with new hydrogen infrastructure. Investment on this scale depends on expedited
planning and permitting processes.
Expanded, modernised and cybersecure transmission and distribution grids are critical to
electricity security in a world where the share of solar PV and wind in electricity generation
is rising rapidly. Investment is needed to provide adequate system flexibility, without which
there is a risk of rising amounts of surplus solar PV and wind power at times when output
exceeds demand. Batteries and demand response play a critical role in meeting hourly

variability, while dispatchable low-emissions capacity – fossil fuel capacity with CCUS,
hydropower, biomass power, nuclear, and hydrogen and ammonia-based plants – play a
critical role in smoothing variability across seasons.

Make transitions resilient, inclusive and affordable
Clean energy transitions require significantly fewer extractive resources in aggregate than
the current energy system: for every unit of energy delivered in 2050, the energy system in
the NZE Scenario consumes two-thirds less in materials, fossil fuels and critical minerals
combined, than it does today. But that does not remove concerns about energy and mineral
security, indeed some concerns may intensify as the energy sector is transformed across the
world.
As demand for oil and gas declines, supply starts to become concentrated in large resourceholders whose economies are most vulnerable to the process of change. There are also
potential risks to the supply of critical minerals that are vital to the manufacture of many
clean energy technologies. Although capital spending for development of critical minerals
saw a 30% increase in 2022 and exploration spending rose by 20%, announced critical
mineral mining projects are not sufficient to meet the needs of the NZE Scenario in 2030.
Bridging this gap requires a strong focus on investment in mining, processing and refining, as
well as on recycling and technology innovation.
Policy makers need to pay close attention to the resilience of clean energy technology supply
chains. For the moment, these exhibit a higher degree of geographical concentration than
fossil fuels, with China having a notably strong position. This presents an elevated risk of
disruption, whether from geopolitical tensions, extreme weather or a simple industrial
accident. Many countries are now seeking to promote more diverse patterns of investment
and manufacturing in clean energy supply, including for critical minerals. Finding ways to do
so while continuing to enjoy the benefits of trade is difficult but crucial.
Governments also need to make sure that the process of change works for everyone,
including vulnerable communities and those whose livelihoods are affected by changes in
fuels and technologies. This requires an active effort to help poorer households to meet the
upfront costs of clean energy technologies and then benefit from their lower operating costs
(section 1.6). As an example, a deep building retrofit – an integrated set of energy
conservation measures to significantly improve overall building performance – for an
average size home can cost four to nine months of income for Chinese or US households in
the 25th income percentile, compared with one to two months for households in the
75th percentile.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Find ways for governments to work together
Above all, countries need to find ways to make this a common, unified effort. This is vital to
expand financial flows to developing economies, to accelerate clean energy technology
development, to ensure equitable and cost-effective clean energy supply, and to ensure that
effective safety nets are in place in case of disruptions. The pathway to net zero emissions is
much more complex and costly in a low-trust, low-collaboration world (section 1.9).
48

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

1.5

Capital flows are gaining pace, but not reaching the
areas of greatest need

After a period of stagnation in the latter part of the 2010s, energy investment is picking up.
The IEA estimates that USD 2.8 trillion is set to be invested in different parts of the energy
sector in 2023, up from USD 2.2 trillion five years ago. Almost all of the increase in the last
five years has been directed to clean energy and infrastructure, which now accounts for
USD 1.8 trillion in spending, compared with around USD 1 trillion on fossil fuels (IEA, 2023c).
All scenarios see a need for increased energy investment from historic levels. Total energy
investment rises to USD 3.2 trillion in 2030 in the STEPS, USD 3.8 trillion in the APS and
USD 4.7 trillion in the NZE Scenario. Achieving the transformation in the NZE Scenario
requires energy investment as a share of GDP to increase by around one percentage point
between 2023 and 2030, but the ratio falls back to the current level by 2050 (Figure 1.19).

An increasing share of investment is directed to clean energy in all scenarios. In the STEPS,
the ratio of investment in fossil fuels to investment in clean energy technologies rises from
1:1.8 in 2023 to 1:2.5 in 2030. In the NZE Scenario, it rises to more than 1:10 in 2030. The
USD 2.5 trillion increase in clean energy investment in the NZE Scenario to 2030 is far larger
than the USD 0.6 trillion reduction in fossil fuel investment over this period.
Today’s higher interest rate environment has increased financing costs for energy, and this
has had a particularly large impact on relatively capital-intensive clean energy technologies.
Emerging market and developing economies in particular are struggling with rising financing

costs as higher base rates push up the cost of capital. A combination of policy reforms and
de-risking measures, including revenue guarantees, first loss guarantees and currency
hedging, is needed to address real and perceived project and country risks.
The large increase in capital investment in the NZE Scenario is partly compensated for by
lower operating costs that follow the shift away from fossil fuels towards capital-intensive
clean technologies. For fossil fuel importing countries, the shift towards clean energy also
improves trade balances and enhances energy security as the share of energy met through
domestically sourced renewables starts to rise.

1.5.1

Fossil fuels

Continued investment in fossil fuels is essential in all of our scenarios. It is needed to meet
increases in demand over the period to 2030 in the STEPS and to avoid a precipitous decline
in supply that would far outstrip even the rapid declines in demand seen in the NZE Scenario.
In previous editions of the WEO, we warned of a risk of underinvestment in a STEPS-like
trajectory for demand, noting a gap between the amounts being invested in oil and gas and
the future requirements of this scenario. But the situation has evolved and this is no longer
the case. Oil and gas investment has risen in recent years, while the benchmark level of
investment needed in 2030 has come down with improvements in the capital efficiency of
the oil and gas industry and with a decline in the projected level of oil and gas demand.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to some shortfalls in supply, but immediate issues have now
receded because Russian oil production and export has been more resilient than initially
anticipated and because a wave of new supply projects, notably for LNG, have received the
go-ahead. As a result, the level of investment in oil and gas expected in 2023 is broadly
equivalent to the level needed in the STEPS in 2030, and the fears expressed by some large
resource-holders and certain oil and gas companies that the world is underinvesting in oil
and gas supply are no longer based on the latest technology and market trends.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The risks of overinvestment in fossil fuels have also evolved, but in the opposite direction.
Investment in oil and gas today is significantly higher than the amounts needed in the APS
and almost double what is needed in the NZE Scenario (Figure 1.20). This creates the clear
risk of locking in fossil fuel use and putting the 1.5 °C goal out of reach. Nonetheless, simply
cutting spending on oil and gas will not get the world on track for the NZE Scenario: the key
is to scale up investment in all aspects of a clean energy system to meet rising demand for
energy services in a sustainable way.
Both overinvestment and underinvestment in fossil fuels carry risks for secure and affordable
energy transitions. Any assessment of the implications of investment needs to take into
account who is investing and the efficiency of the spending, and policy makers need to be
mindful in particular of trends that could point to a future concentration in supply or other
energy security risks. When it comes to the overall adequacy of spending, however, our
analysis suggests that the risks are weighted more towards overinvestment than the
opposite.

1.5.2

Clean energy

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The rise in clean energy spending in recent years has been concentrated in areas linked to
clean electrification, in particular solar PV and other forms of renewable power, and end-use
electrification, especially EVs and heat pumps (Figure 1.21). If it is maintained, the rate at
which clean energy is growing would put aggregate global spending in 2030 on low-emissions
power, grids, storage and end-use electrification at levels consistent with the needs of the
APS. For some technologies, notably solar PV, it would go beyond the investment required
for the NZE Scenario. However, there are significant gaps in spending on other pillars of clean
energy transitions. In particular, investment in energy efficiency remains well short of what
is needed in the APS and NZE Scenario, despite rising recently. Investment in low-emissions
fuels is another area where more is needed: it is increasing, thanks to increased policy
support for areas like low-emissions hydrogen and CCUS, but from a very low base.
The increases in spending required to meet climate goals appear challenging but within reach
for advanced economies and China. Finance is available for clean energy projects, and many
of the main risks, including those related to permitting, now appear to be on the policy and
regulatory side. However, other emerging market and developing economies need to triple
clean energy spending from 2022 levels by 2030 in the APS and increase them over five-times
in the NZE Scenario. Some of the largest gaps are in energy efficiency and end-use
decarbonisation. This reflects the fact that many lower income households and businesses
are struggling to manage the higher upfront costs of a number of clean energy technologies.

It also reflects the relative weakness of policy frameworks, institutional capacity and
enforcement in many countries. The effect of high interest rates on financing costs is another
complicating factor.

Energy efficiency in buildings stands out as a laggard. The urban population is increasing
quickly in most developing economies, and ensuring that new buildings meet high
performance standards for efficient heating and cooling presents a huge opportunity to limit
future strains on energy supply and emissions. However, relatively few emerging market and
developing economies have energy efficiency building codes, with India being a notable
exception. Higher standards and stronger enforcement of standards for new buildings play a
critical role in reducing energy use in buildings in each of the scenarios.

1.6

Transitions have to be affordable

The global energy crisis in 2022 catapulted costs and prices of energy to the forefront of the
political agenda, and countries are understandably concerned about the costs of the
transition. For energy users, a meaningful assessment of transition costs must start with
quantifying the additional spending required on clean energy over conventional options: for
example, the cost premium to purchase an EV over an internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicle, or to install a heat pump instead of a natural gas boiler.

For some applications and in some parts of the world, clean energy technologies are already
cost competitive compared with fossil fuels, meaning net costs are zero or in some cases
negative, even without incentives and other support for upfront costs. In other cases, cost
gaps remain, and incentives will be crucial to accelerate the adoption of key clean energy
measures. These can be narrowed either by reducing the upfront and operating cost of clean
options, e.g. through technology and financial innovation or government intervention like
clean energy subsidies, or by changing pricing, tax and subsidy frameworks for fossil fuels,
e.g. by removing fossil fuel subsidies, or including CO2 costs or other environmental
surcharges.
Such policy interventions however must be carefully designed and targeted: political support
for the transition can dissipate quickly if households or industries bear too much upfront cost
without seeing tangible, near-term benefits. Support may also decrease if insufficient
attention is paid to the distributional effects of clean energy support policies or if the fiscal
burden on governments is perceived as too high. In this section, insights from the scenarios
are used to explore these issues from the perspective of households, industry and
governments.

1.6.1

Affordability for households

The energy crisis squeezed budgets as prices soared in 2022. Government interventions
moderated the extent to which higher commodity prices fed through to higher household
energy bills, nevertheless there were increases in natural gas, petrol and retail electricity
prices in various parts of the world. Clean energy technologies such as EVs or heat pumps
helped shield consumers that had adopted them from fossil fuel price spikes, and energy
efficient buildings and appliances also provided some protection.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Heat pumps, energy efficiency retrofits and EVs – the three most important measures that
households can adopt to accelerate clean energy transitions – are already nearly cost
competitive over their lifetime in the STEPS in advanced economies, even without incentives
(Figure 1.22). Higher upfront costs remain a barrier to accelerated uptake, but in some
markets even upfront costs are reaching price parity. Air-to-air heat pumps can be cheaper
than natural gas boilers in mature markets, for example, and electric cars sold today in China
cost less than their ICE equivalents on average, while more energy efficient air conditioners
and refrigerators do not necessarily come with higher upfront costs in markets across Asia,
Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. Even when clean energy technologies have
higher upfront costs than their fossil fuel equivalents, they frequently generate energy bill
savings over their lifetime because of their lower operating costs. However, the lifetime costs
of clean energy alternatives often remain higher in countries where fossil fuel subsidies have
still not been phased out.
Finding ways to manage the higher upfront costs of clean energy technologies will play a key
role to accelerate their adoption, especially in low income households. Limited disposable
income and more constrained access to financing can put higher cost options out of reach
for a large share of the population. For example, installing a heat pump can cost up to eight

months of income for those with lower incomes (see Chapter 4, section 4.4). Recent interest
rate hikes have increased borrowing costs for consumers and are expected to contribute to
a slowing of household energy efficiency measures if they persist: a factor that governments
will need to take into account in considering how to speed up the adoption of clean energy
technologies.

Key clean energy technologies are already roughly cost competitive over their lifetime,
though upfront cost barriers remain for most
Notes: ICE = internal combustion engine. Assumed lifetimes are 25 years for retrofits, 16 years for heat pumps
and natural gas boilers/furnaces, and 12 years for electric and ICE cars. Costs are based on a representative
sample of households in Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and United States, with upfront costs financed at
an interest rate of 5%, starting in 2024 for five years. Costs do not reflect upfront subsidies.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Energy pricing plays a major role in determining whether clean energy technologies are
competitive in terms of costs, and the fossil fuel subsidies that persist in a number of
countries are clearly important in this context. In emerging market and developing
economies, where the bulk of fossil fuel subsidies exist today, phasing out these subsidies
would raise current household energy bills, in aggregate, by 70%. Fossil fuel subsidies distort
markets and are often ultimately paid by consumers through higher taxes or consumer
prices, especially in importing regions. The effects of subsidy removal on household spending
means that the phase-outs have to be planned carefully and accompanied by support for
those that need it most.
Reforming energy pricing remains essential though, not only to rectify price signals, but to
realise the economy-wide energy cost optimisation. The economy-wide cost of supplying
energy used in households and for personal transport in emerging market and developing
54

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

economies was nearly USD 1.8 trillion in 2022, of which around USD 1 trillion was borne by
consumers. The rest represents fossil fuel subsidies borne by other entities, mostly
governments and state-owned enterprises, either in the form of reduced prices or forgone
revenue. In the NZE Scenario, the economy-wide costs of providing energy decline to
USD 1.6 trillion in 2030, 25% lower than in STEPS (Figure 1.23). However, the removal of
subsidies and gradual introduction of carbon pricing mean that consumers would pay more
per unit of energy, while modern energy consumption increases in absolute terms despite
efficiency gains as rising incomes allow for larger residences and more appliances. In
addition, households need to shoulder the upfront costs of clean energy technologies.

The total cost of supplying energy falls in the NZE Scenario, but vulnerable consumers

Notes: Subsidies = fossil fuel consumption subsidies based on the IEA price-gap approach. Energy spending
includes transport energy spending.

Targeted support could help reduce the impact of energy price reforms, and would be
especially important for low income households. Price reforms should also aim to end rate
structures that penalise electrification of end-uses and to incentivise the provision of timevarying electricity tariffs, for example to allow consumers to charge EVs overnight when
electricity demand and prices are lower.

1.6.2

Affordability for industry

Industry was more exposed to high commodity prices during the energy crisis than
households. Although some larger industries were able to draw on contracting and hedging
strategies to guard against commodity price volatility, in aggregate industry paid on average
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

70% more for natural gas in 2022 than they did in 2021, and around 25% more for electricity.
The protection provided for households by governments in many countries means that
industry had to cope with much higher price increases than did households.
For energy-intensive industries, adopting clean energy technologies while maintaining
competitiveness is one of the defining challenges of the energy transition. Many efficiency
and clean energy measures in light industry are already cost effective, notably efficient
electric motors and heat pumps for low-temperature heat (IEA, 2022b). However, there are
fewer cost-competitive clean alternatives for large, energy-intensive industries than for
households and light industry, and many of them involve significant upfront capital
expenditure. Moreover, many of the clean energy technologies needed by energy-intensive
industries are at the demonstration phase.
The position is not straightforward even where new clean technologies are feasible. Many
energy-intensive products such as steel or chemicals are traded internationally in
competitive markets with margins that are too slim to absorb elevated production costs or
to encourage first movers to adopt new technologies. This means that there is an ever
present risk of industrial relocation if environmental regulations or energy prices put firms in
international markets at a competitive disadvantage. Relocation of businesses in these
circumstances to jurisdictions where such regulations are not imposed defeats the purpose
for which the regulations were introduced, to say nothing of the damage done to the
industrial base in the country that sees the companies depart. This has prompted efforts to
implement carbon border adjustment measures and similar pricing schemes to level the
playing field and maintain the competitiveness of companies and sectors that adopt
decarbonising measures. Revenue from such price rectifying measures can be recycled to
help manage the higher material input costs to businesses, which eventually reach the end
consumer through higher prices. Industry-led initiatives, such as the First Mover Coalition
Steel Commitment, and international agreements on collaboration on industry
decarbonisations, like the Glasgow Breakthrough Agenda, can also play a useful role.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the NZE Scenario, industry spending on energy reaches USD 4.3 trillion in 2030, around
30% more than in the STEPS, even though demand is moderated by material and energy
efficiency improvements. The higher costs are due to novel processes in energy-intensive
industry, which in many cases have higher input energy costs, and also to increased carbon
prices and the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies.
Pricing emissions from industry remains important to stimulate the switch to clean energy
because it helps to improve the cost competitiveness of clean energy technologies and boost
their adoption. For instance, carbon pricing and subsidy reform raise the production costs
for conventional steel in the NZE Scenario by 2030 and thereby narrow the cost gap with
electrolytic hydrogen-based production routes. Nonetheless, electrolytic hydrogen-based
steel is still at a premium. In some cases, and especially those where there is easy access to
plentiful renewable sources of energy, the gap can be closed by 2030 (Figure 1.24). In other
cases, government support is likely to be necessary, not least to help create demand for near
zero emissions steel, for example through public procurement. Some important steel making
56

regions (such as Europe, Japan and Korea) might require subsidies for hydrogen to be cost
competitive globally.

1.6.3

Affordability for governments

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Governments need to take urgent action to tackle climate change. Yet, many countries,
especially emerging market and developing economies, are grappling with increased debt,
inflation and uncertain growth prospects. There are multiple demands on public budgets to
address development needs, and so governments must design fiscally responsible policies
that strike a balance between spending and revenue-based measures (IMF, 2023).
In the NZE Scenario, governments are expected to finance around 30% of the USD 4.2 trillion
of clean energy investment spending required in 2030. This includes through low cost loans,
grants, direct support to households and industries, and concessional finance. An important
question is how governments finance this investment in a scenario where revenues from
taxing the production and consumption of oil and gas are falling. In the NZE Scenario, public
revenue from taxing CO2 goes some way to offset declining oil and gas revenues, reductions
in fossil fuel subsidies provide some direct relief for governments, and taxes on the use of
electricity shore up revenue from energy consumption (Figure 1.25). However, governments
around the world will make their own decisions about funding based on their specific
priorities and national circumstances.

Carbon pricing revenues and lower subsidy burdens offset lower fossil fuel rents in exporting
regions; for net importers, carbon revenue provides funds for clean energy initiatives

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

For net oil and gas exporters, economic growth in the NZE Scenario is underpinned by
economic diversification rather than continued reliance on fuel exports and royalties. This
enlarges the taxable industrial and consumer base, and helps to minimise the transfer of
rents from producer to consumer countries that apply CO2 taxation. The lower level of fossil
fuel subsidy support in the NZE Scenario and taxes on consumer spending on electricity
together offset declining revenues from fossil fuel production, meaning that the net fiscal
position in the NZE Scenario in 2030 is comparable to that of STEPS. However, this shift
requires citizens and businesses to absorb more of the cost of energy directly through higher
upfront investment and higher annual spending on fuels in the near term. To the extent that
governments see tangible savings on the public balance sheet from fossil fuel subsidy
removal, these can be funnelled into clean energy support mechanisms or otherwise used to
help to pay for climate change adaptation or other sustainable public spending initiatives,
such as social support schemes to help vulnerable consumers.

Risks on the road to a more electrified future

Electricity demand is projected to increase significantly in sectors ranging from industry and
buildings to transport. Yet, this trajectory is not set in stone, and there are a number of risks
that could hamper the deployment of key clean electricity technologies. One of the most
important risks to projected growth in electrification is the availability of critical minerals for
power generation technologies, electricity networks, battery storage and electric vehicles.
These trends and risks are discussed in detail in this Outlook and summarised in this section.

Notes: Hydrogen production is the electricity needed for its production and the share of electricity in total
energy consumed in the process of producing hydrogen. Intensive industries (energy-intensive industries)
include iron and steel, chemicals, non‐metallic minerals, non‐ferrous metals, and paper, pulp and printing
industries. Other industry includes the remaining industrial branches, i.e. construction, mining and textiles.
Appliances and cooking includes stoves and ovens, refrigerators, washing and dishwashing machines, clothes
dryers, brown appliances (relatively light electronic appliances such as computers or televisions) and other
electric appliances (excluding lighting, cooling, cleaning and desalination). Cooling and heating include space
and water heating, and space cooling in buildings.

The importance of electricity rises in many applications over the outlook period (Figure 1.26).
The biggest consumers of electricity today are the buildings and industry sectors, which
together account for over 90% of global electricity consumption. Appliances, cooking, cooling
and heating account for most consumption in buildings, and electricity demand increases for
all of them in our projections, especially in emerging market and developing economies.
Industrial electricity demand continues to rise as industrial output increases, mostly in
emerging market and developing economies, and as policies to reduce emissions encourage
the electrification of industrial equipment. Transport is also a major contributor to projected
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

electricity demand growth, especially in advanced economies. The number of EVs has
increased rapidly in recent years, with electric car sales surpassing 10 million in 2022. In the
STEPS, electric cars gain a market share of 38% in new car sales by 2030; in the APS, this rises
to nearly 45%.

1.7.1

Managing risks for rapid electrification

Technologies essential to clean electricity systems need to scale up rapidly for electrification
to proceed at the pace necessary to meet the energy and climate pledges made by
governments around the world. However, there are risks that could delay or impede the
deployment of some of the key technologies that are needed. It is critical to have sufficient
policy support and enabling regulatory frameworks, efficient and timely permitting and
certification, while developing robust and resilient supply chains, from raw materials to
manufacturing and construction and skilled labour to ensuring access to financing. Reducing
the costs of financing and having predictability for revenues or cost savings are also
important for rapid electrification. Each technology has its unique risk profile, which may
threaten its role in clean electrification (Table 1.1). Progress in one technology may depend
on progress in others. The lower these risks are across the board, the better the chance to
deliver secure and affordable transitions, calling on governments and industry to take action.

Regulatory and policy risks include regulatory barriers, inadequate policy support, and slow
planning and permitting. Regulatory barriers can inhibit the deployment of technologies,
either directly or by closing off potential business cases that developers could pursue in a
more supportive or effective regulatory environment. Demand response, a potential key
source of power system flexibility in the future is a good example (see Chapter 4). In many
markets today, consumers have little incentive to be responsive because short-term price
signals from electricity markets are not transmitted to them. A lack of sufficient and
continuous policy support increases investor uncertainty, and the sudden withdrawal of
policy support can cause nascent markets to crash, as experience has shown with solar PV
and wind power in several markets over the past 15 years. Lengthy certification and
permitting processes slow deployment and raise costs, as seen in the wind industry (IEA,
2023b), in the construction of new nuclear power plants (IEA, 2022c) and in the expansion of
power grids (IEA, 2023d).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There are further potential sources of risk along the supply chain of clean energy
technologies. Some relate to the fact that both the supply of critical minerals and the
manufacture of solar modules and other key goods are dominated by a small number of
countries (section 1.9). Others stem from the danger that demand will outpace the scaling
up of mining, processing and manufacturing capacity along the supply chain, pushing up costs
and constraining clean energy transitions. In 2021 and 2022, for example, higher input prices
for critical minerals, semiconductors and bulk materials resulted in price increases for key
clean energy technologies (IEA, 2023c). Another set of risk arises from the need for skilled
labour across the various links of clean energy supply chains. Tight labour markets and a
shortage of skilled labour have recently contributed to disruptions and project delays in parts
of the electricity sector, most notably for offshore wind (IEA, 2022d). Shortages of workers
with specific skills are also slowing the expansion of power grids, the construction of new
nuclear power plants and the installation of heat pumps (IEA, 2022b). The lack of skilled
labour in some sectors underlines the need for collaboration and investment in education
and training programmes to develop a skilled workforce capable of supporting the
construction, and operation and maintenance of key clean electricity technologies.
Financing risks also need to be addressed, including those that relate to the cost of obtaining
finance, to the difficulty of predicting future revenues when new technologies enter the
market, and to market instability. Long-term contracting can help to reduce price uncertainty
for developers of clean electricity projects, and high quality, high reliability products and
components can help to reduce the risk of poor performance. Financing costs for clean
energy projects have recently been driven up significantly by rising interest rates in markets
around the world, in particular in emerging market and developing economies (IEA, 2023c).
Increases in financing costs have the biggest impact on large-scale projects involving capitalintensive technologies such as offshore wind, grids or new nuclear power plants, but rising
interest rates also affect consumers that rely on credit to finance an EV or the installation of
a heat pump. The progress of electrification will depend on reducing the cost and improving
the availability of capital. This is of particular importance for emerging market and
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

61

developing economies, many of which are currently struggling to raise the capital needed to
finance their transitions (IEA, 2021a).
It is important to highlight that these risks are not isolated from one another but are often
interdependent. A lack of policy support can, for example, make a project less bankable
which raises financing costs. Permitting delays also raise financing costs, while the poorer
than expected performance of an asset will depress revenue or raise maintenance costs.
Disruptions at one stage of the supply chain can feed through to other technologies, sectors
and markets. Poor progress for one technology can also negatively affect others. Delays in
extending and reinforcing power grids, for example, can also slow the deployment of
renewables, heat pumps and EVs. Lowering risks across the board is vital, whether those risks
relate to regulation and policy, clean electricity supply chains, the availability of skilled labour
or access to finance. This highlights the need for a holistic approach that ensures every
technology is able to play its role in delivering secure and cost-effective electrification.

1.7.2

Critical minerals underpin electrification

The transformation of the electricity system and increasing electrification leads to rising
demand for critical minerals. The size of the market for key critical minerals used in the
energy sector has doubled over the past five years and growth is expected to pick up further
(IEA, 2023e). As clean energy transitions accelerate, the focus will shift from the supply of
traditional fuels to the supply of critical minerals (see Chapter 4). However, the mining and
processing of certain critical minerals is heavily concentrated geographically, creating a
security of supply risk. Long lead times for mines and the associated infrastructure mean that
scaling up supplies takes time, raising the risk of supply bottlenecks. Mitigating these risks
requires governments and industry to establish a more diversified network of international
producer-consumer relationships, while seeking to ensure that supplies scale up fast enough
to meet growing demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Copper, rare earth elements, silicon and various battery metals, notably lithium, are critical
minerals for electrification. Copper is used extensively in electricity transmission and
distribution grids, but its conductive properties also make it an essential component for lowemissions power generation technologies such as solar PV modules, wind turbines and
batteries. Rare earth elements (REEs) are used to manufacture the permanent magnets for
the motors of direct drive and hybrid wind turbines. Silicon is used to manufacture solar
panels. As the deployment of variable renewable technologies increases, the need for
storage technologies to complement renewable electricity rises rapidly. Lithium-ion batteries
dominate in EVs and are the fastest growing electricity storage technology in the world,
making lithium indispensable for electrification (IEA, 2021b).
In terms of absolute volumes, copper dominates total demand for critical minerals in clean
energy applications, mostly for use in the electricity sector: current demand of around 6 Mt
per year rises to 11 Mt by 2030 in the STEPS and 12 Mt in the APS. However, lithium sees the
biggest percentage increase: demand for lithium for battery storage systems and EVs rises
62

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

more than fivefold from its current level by 2030 in the STEPS and nearly sevenfold by 2030
in the APS. Demand for copper, silicon and REEs nearly doubles to 2030 in the STEPS and
rises almost 2.5-fold in the APS (Figure 1.27).

This underlines that scaling up critical minerals supplies while making them more secure is a
key challenge. More diverse and resilient critical mineral supply chains are an essential
element. These need not just to deliver a reliable supply of critical minerals but also to apply
environmental, social and governance standards to their production and processing. Clear
policy commitments to scale up clean energy technologies are essential to stimulate the
investments that are needed.

A new, lower carbon pathway for emerging market
and developing economies is taking shape

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Emerging market and developing economies face a diverse set of development challenges
that will largely shape their regional energy and emissions pathways, and that therefore have
global implications. Some 64% of the world population lives in emerging market and
developing economies other than China. These countries have an average per capita income
that is around one-fifth of the average in advanced economies, and they lag on various
socio-economic and energy indicators (Figure 1.28).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The emerging market and developing economies other than China include a diverse range of
countries. Most face energy-related development challenges that broadly include:


To provide universal energy access to those who do not have electricity (775 million
people in emerging market and developing economies other than China) and those who
lack access to clean cooking fuels and equipment (2 billion people in the same group).
UN Sustainable Development Goal-7 includes a target for the achievement of universal
energy access by 2030, and this is currently off track.



To facilitate further industrialisation and the modernisation of agriculture, both of which
require access to affordable and secure supplies of technologies and energy. The
economic output from industry in emerging market and developing economies
(excluding China) grows by over 30% by 2030, and more than doubles by 2050. The
corresponding energy demand from industry rises by over 20% by 2030 and 65% by 2050
in the STEPS.



To deliver planned urban growth with efficient modern housing that is well served by
public transport. The urbanisation rate, built space per capita, air conditioner ownership
and car ownership rates in emerging market and developing economies other than
China are far lower than in advanced economies. By 2050, an additional 1.8 billion
people will be living in urban areas in emerging market and developing economies
(excluding China), contributing to a doubling of residential building space and a sharp
rise in urban transport demand.

64

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023





To play a bigger part in global energy supply chains, including through domestic clean
energy technology manufacturing. Fossil fuel supply, clean energy manufacturing,
critical mineral production and refining capacities remain geographically concentrated
to varying degrees. Emerging market and developing economies today are particularly
vulnerable to supply shocks while wealthier importers are better placed financially to
secure their energy and technology needs.
To reduce environmental pollutants from energy operations. Air pollution from energy
use is a major concern, leading to over 5 million premature deaths every year in
emerging market and developing economies (excluding China).

The choices countries make to address these development challenges and their emissions
reduction commitments will together shape their future energy policy choices. Historically,
economic development has been fuelled by carbon-intensive technologies and sources of
energy derived from fossil fuels, but there are several factors that now point to the possibility
of a markedly different development pathway for emerging market and developing
economies.
First, as discussed in this report, clean energy technology costs have been falling across a
broad suite of applications worldwide from clean electricity generation to clean mobility,
energy storage and energy efficiency. In some cases, such as electricity generation, clean
technologies are now the lowest cost options in most parts of the world. As a result, they
now offer promising avenues for energy and industrial development. However, there are
barriers that need to be overcome for emerging market and developing economies to make
the most of these opportunities. These are often linked to risks that could call into question
the bankability of projects in these economies. They include regulatory and policy risks such
as inconsistent tariff regimes, off-taker risks such as the financial weakness of power
distribution companies, and land acquisition risks such as permitting issues. Risk mitigation
through appropriate policy making and regulation has a key role to play in managing these
risks, together with financial innovation.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Second, the acceleration of renewable energy deployment is being coupled with increasing
electrification of economic activity, even in developing economies. In the past five years, over
half of the capacity additions for electricity generation in the emerging market and
developing economies other than China are renewables based. This marks a significant
acceleration compared to the previous decade, when renewables accounted for around a
quarter of capacity additions; further acceleration is likely in the future. In the STEPS, nearly
two-thirds of new capacity additions to 2030 are renewables. By 2050, electricity generation
from renewables increases fivefold in the STEPS, and over ten-fold in APS by 2050
(Figure 1.29).
Increasing deployment of renewables is being accompanied in emerging market and
developing economies by increased electrification, with expanding use of EVs in transport,
electric furnaces and electrochemical processes in industry, electric cooking appliances in the
buildings sector, and electric farm equipment such as solar pumps in agriculture. In the
STEPS, the share of electricity in total final energy consumption among the emerging market

and developing economies other than China increases from 15% to nearly 25% by 2050, while
in the APS it reaches almost 35% in the same period. Early signs of increased electrification
are already apparent. In India, for example, over half of three-wheel vehicle sales are now
electric, and in South Africa electricity now meets 80% of residential cooking energy demand.
Other countries look set to emulate these examples: for example, the share of energy
demand for cooking met by electricity in emerging market and developing economies nearly
doubles by 2050 in the APS.

Third, high fossil fuel import dependence, fuel price volatility and large subsidy burdens are
concerns shared by many importing countries; clean energy technologies offer scope to
reduce them. While the scaling up of clean energy also necessitates imports due to the
concentration of supply chains, the use of clean energy reduces risks from price volatility
once the necessary infrastructure is in place. All countries are affected by fuel price volatility,
but countries with lower incomes suffer acutely more as a result of their limited fiscal room
to manoeuvre and less affordability among consumers. Over the past decade, emerging
market and developing countries have cumulatively spent USD 3.7 trillion on oil, natural gas,
and coal subsidies (USD 3.2 trillion excluding China). Annual subsidies have fluctuated
significantly with movements in energy prices, with subsides nearly four-times higher in 2022
than in 2016, and the unpredictable nature of fuel prices has made fiscal planning difficult.
In the APS, USD 3.8 trillion is invested in clean energy infrastructure and equipment
cumulatively to 2030 to keep emerging market and developing economies (other than China)
on the pathway to meet long-term clean energy ambitions, and these investments displace
fossil fuel demand, therefore reducing exposure to price volatility and supply shocks.
66

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

As well, there is increasing recognition of the potential for clean energy technology
manufacturing and critical mineral extraction and refining to act as engines of economic and
employment growth. As efforts to create a new global clean energy economy gain
momentum, developing countries risk missing out on emerging economic opportunities.
Some emerging market and developing countries are already taking initial steps to expand
their involvement in the unfolding new clean energy economy. For example, the Indonesia
Battery Corporation was established by the government in 2021 to help the country become
a leading supplier of EV batteries, with a target to manufacture 140 gigawatt-hour (GWh)
battery capacity by 2030. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of nickel, and it aims to
move up the value chain of mineral supplies. India implemented the Production Linked
Incentives programme to incentivise the production of solar PV modules and batteries. It
aims to stimulate greenfield manufacturing capacity and to create new jobs.

As a result of these and other related factors, notably efficiency improvements, all global
regions see increasing use of clean energy technologies and reductions in the fossil fuel
energy and emissions intensity of GDP across the IEA scenarios. This implies that lower levels
of fossil fuel supplies are needed over time to generate the same amount of economic
output, and that a given level of economic output is associated with falling emissions over
time. There are steep declines in both these metrics across regions (Figure 1.30). Both fossil
fuel and CO2 emissions intensities fall by half in the STEPS by 2050, and by over 70% in the
APS in emerging market and developing economies (other than China). As a result, even as
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

GDP nearly triples by 2050 in this group, aggregate annual CO2 emissions rise by only a
quarter in the STEPS and fall by 30% in the APS.
Emerging market and developing countries are not bound to track the kind of emissions
intensive pathways that have been followed in the past. However, the degree to which such
countries are able to chart alternate pathways depends on the amount of investment in clean
energy and efficiency technologies that they are able to attract, and on the ability of
countries and households to pay upfront clean energy infrastructure costs. Effective policies
and regulatory frameworks will be important in this context, as will the development of
domestic financial markets and the availability of international finance.

1.9

Geopolitical tensions undermine energy security and
prospects for rapid, affordable transitions

Geopolitics and energy have been intertwined throughout the fossil fuel era: importers have
come to depend on exporters for supplies, and exporters have similarly come to depend on
importers for revenue. Political and commercial relationships between producers and
consumers have ebbed and flowed as a way to manage these dependencies, but risks have
also been mitigated by open international energy markets, initially for oil, more recently also
for natural gas. Well-functioning markets, alongside safety nets such as spare capacity held
by key producers and the IEA co-ordinated system of oil stocks, have helped countries to
manage shifts in supply and demand: they have also provided a buffer against disruptions
caused by extreme weather or geopolitical events. Trade provides access to a large balancing
area to manage shifts in supply or demand: this insight is also becoming increasingly valuable
for electricity security in interconnected and renewables-rich markets.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine provided a stern test of the resilience of today’s energy system
to geopolitical shocks. The price spikes that followed cuts to gas supply from Russia were
certainly very damaging, but the attempt by Russia to use gas supply for political leverage
failed. Russia has lost its largest customer, shredded its reputation as a reliable exporter and
created incentives for consumers to consider alternatives to natural gas. This is reflected in
our projections: the global energy crisis has prompted a significant downward revision to
natural gas demand in the STEPS and to Russian gas exports (section 1.10).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The recent crisis has shown how geopolitical events can affect the energy sector. However,
the relationship works both ways: changes in energy markets can also shape geopolitics. As
energy transitions proceed, they shift demand across fuels and sources of electricity in ways
that eventually loosen the grip of fossil fuel resource-holders. The process will be a long one
and fossil fuel producers remain influential. Indeed, the share of the Organization of Oil
Exporting Countries (OPEC) in global supply rises over time in our NZE Scenario as demand
falls. But in exercising this influence they reduce it, because consumers have an increasing
range of mature clean energy options that become more attractive as a result.
Energy transitions do not, however, mean an end to geopolitical risks. Traditional risks
around fossil fuel supply evolve, but they do not disappear. Transitions could be destabilising
68

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

for fragile producing states that fail to diversify away from high dependence on hydrocarbon
revenues. In the meantime, new geopolitical risks and dependencies arise in clean energy
supply chains (Bordoff and O’Sullivan, 2023). And both traditional and new security risks are
worsened in a more fragmented international system characterised by rivalries and low cooperation.
The world can ill afford these tensions if it wants to get on track to limit global warming to
1.5 °C. As the acceleration in clean energy deployment in recent years showed, periods of
disruption and high fossil fuel prices can give additional momentum to transitions. But this is
a very costly way to change the system. The latest numbers from the IEA Government Energy
Spending Tracker show that over USD 1.3 trillion has been allocated by governments for
clean energy investment support since 2020 (IEA, 2023f). However, since the start of the
energy crisis, governments have also allocated some USD 900 billion to short-term consumer
affordability measures. In emerging market and developing economies, governments have
dedicated more to consumer affordability measures (USD 140 billion) than to clean energy
investment support (USD 90 billion). Moving from crisis to crisis is no way to manage the
clean energy transition.
There is limited scope to incorporate geopolitical shocks into our long-term Outlook scenario
structure, given that their effects and duration are by their nature unpredictable.
Nonetheless, the baseline expectation is for a future mixture of rivalry and collaboration.
Elements of geopolitics come through in the STEPS, especially in relation to the position of
Russia in international energy trade, but the hope is that co-operation on clean energy can
be ringfenced from broader geopolitical tensions so as to allow rapid progress towards global
net zero emissions in line with the NZE Scenario, which depends on co-operation between
countries: without this, its objectives fall out of reach.
The next section explores how the energy sector might fare in a world that is lower on trust
and lower on co-operation than our baseline expectations. It considers in particular how
geopolitical tensions might affect the outlook both for clean energy and for fossil fuels.

1.9.1

Clean energy in a low-trust world

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Opportunities to produce low-emissions energy cost competitively are far more widely
distributed around the world than is the case for fossil fuels. It would therefore be natural to
assume that, as a largely domestic source of energy, renewables would fare better in a more
fragmented international context, especially in countries that rely on imported fuels. The
energy crisis in 2022 provides supporting evidence for this, with deployment of renewable
power and improvements in efficiency in the European Union covering nearly 20 bcm or 25%
of the supply gap left by Russia’s actions. Domestically produced clean energy can clearly be
an asset at times of geopolitical stress.
However, while renewable resources are widely distributed, the same is not true for clean
energy supply chains, which are heavily concentrated. IEA analysis from the most recent
Energy Technology Perspectives 2023 brings out clearly that the three largest producer
countries account for at least 70% of manufacturing capacity for key mass-manufactured
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

technologies – wind, batteries, electrolysers, solar panels and heat pumps – with China
dominant in each (IEA, 2023g). For critical minerals, resources are spread quite widely but
current mining activities are highly concentrated, much more so than is the case for fossil
fuel supply (Figure 1.31). China has invested heavily in midstream refining and processing
and has a very strong position in both.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Overall, China’s investment in clean energy supply chains has helped bring down costs
worldwide, with multiple benefits for clean energy transitions. There is also a distinction to
be made between energy security hazards in fuel markets (which affect all consumers using
the fuel) and those in clean energy supply chains (which affect only the flow of new
manufactured products). Nonetheless, one of the clearest lessons from the history of the
energy sector still stands: high reliance on single countries, companies or trade routes makes
the system vulnerable to unexpected events, be they related to the policy choices of an
individual country, natural disasters, technical failures or company decisions. These risks are
inevitably heightened at times of geopolitical stress.
A low-trust world could create incentives to rely more on domestically produced clean
energy, but these incentives could be undercut in practice by a reluctance to rely heavily on
imported technologies, or shaped by a preference for those technologies that require the
fewest imported elements, or those where the risks of supply chain disruptions seem lowest.
Supply of critical minerals could be a particular pressure point, since now there are relatively
few buffers in place to cope with interruptions or disruptions, markets are thinly traded and
often opaque, and restrictions on trade have risen in recent years.
70

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Given the high degree of concentration in energy supply chains, there are justifiable reasons
for countries to seek to increase the resilience of clean energy supply chains through
industrial policies and support for broader supply diversity. The risk in a low-trust world is
that this process could tip over into much more widespread barriers to trade as countries
prioritise autonomy over managed dependence, and in so doing add costs, complexity and
time to the process of change. Barriers to trade of this kind would also limit the scope for
cost-effective development of new clean technology markets, which depend heavily on
technology learning and collaborations across national borders. Without co-operation, some
countries – especially emerging market and developing economies – could struggle to gain a
stake in the new clean energy economy, and some of the clean technology markets that are
needed for a net zero emissions energy system could take much longer to gain momentum,
or fail to take off at all.

1.9.2

Fossil fuels in a low-trust world

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, tensions in the Middle East underscore the potential
risks that continue to face oil and gas supply. The STEPS projections highlight that many
emerging market and developing economies, notably in Asia, see a significant increase in oil
and gas imports both in terms of volume and cost (Figure 1.32). A low-trust world would
create incentives to limit these vulnerabilities in favour of resources that are available
domestically. As noted, this could create some upside for clean energy, with caveats. But it
could also keep coal in the mix for longer as well.
Where resources are available, importing countries could also try to manage vulnerabilities
by prioritising domestic production of oil and gas, including by greenlighting new projects.
While this might potentially provide some support at the margin, it is unlikely to deliver
additional production quickly (with the exception of some short-cycle developments such as
shale). Historically it has taken well over ten years on average for a conventional project to
move from licensing to first production. Moreover, such an approach would come with a risk
of pushing global production beyond the 1.5 °C threshold, and of new projects becoming
loss-making if the world gets on track to keep global warming below 1.5 °C.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The outlook for natural gas would face additional uncertainties in a world of high geopolitical
tensions. A significant new wave of LNG export facilities is under construction: 250 bcm per
year of liquefaction capacity is scheduled to start operation by the end of 2030, which is
equivalent to almost half of global LNG supply in 2022. The United States and Qatar account
for 60% of the additional LNG, with Asia the intended market: China alone has contracted for
an additional 85 bcm of gas since 2022. Gas markets have become increasingly deep and
liquid in recent years, a development that has underpinned investor confidence and an
enhanced ability to respond to shocks. A reversal of this trend would reduce optionality and
security.
Oil markets too could see trade being further determined by political considerations and
relationships, as producers attempt to tie in consumers and buyers seek more security. This
would come at a cost to efficiency, and could lock in fossil fuel use and related CO2 emissions.

1.9.3

Risks of new dividing lines

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There are major hazards for the energy outlook in a more fragmented and divided world.
Such a world could well reduce the ability of countries to tackle climate change, to ensure
energy security and to respond to a host of other energy-related challenges. A particular risk
is that dividing lines that disadvantage emerging market and developing economies could
become entrenched, constraining their ability to access finance and to participate in global
supply chains. Competition to secure critical mineral supplies could also mitigate against the
push to raise standards, and could result in more tacit acceptance of the kind of poor labour
practices and exploitative resource extraction policies that have impoverished countries in
the past.
Without international co-operation, the chances of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C recede
over the horizon and out of sight. The world needs to embrace a rules-based trading system
if energy transitions are to succeed. It will not be possible to expand clean energy in line with
the NZE Scenario if countries prioritise self-sufficiency over integration and trade. Nor will it
be possible to prevent the road ahead from looking increasingly bumpy and perilous from an
energy security perspective if countries start to lose the benefits of interconnected markets
as a way of coping with shifts in supply and demand and of riding out unexpected shocks. In
these circumstances, a worsening climate could itself pose an increasingly significant threat
in the coming decades, widening any fractures in international affairs in the process. This all
points to the vital importance of redoubling collaboration and co-operation, not retreating
from it.

1.10 As the facts change, so do our projections
The STEPS illustrates the direction in which current policy settings are steering the energy
sector based on a sector-by-sector assessment of existing policies and announcements. This
trajectory is updated on an annual basis in line with changes in policy settings, market
conditions and technology developments, and it is instructive to look at how the projections
have evolved over time. Any company or policy maker considering our Outlook needs to bear
in mind the dynamic nature of the scenario: for example, if a company chooses to align its
investments with STEPS, it needs to be aware that this is a moving target.

In this Outlook, the power sector taps significantly more renewables and

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Changes in starting conditions since the World Energy Outlook-2022 (WEO-2022) have had a
material impact on the outlook for energy (Figure 1.33). As discussed in section 1.1, this 2023
Outlook is the first time that a scenario based on existing policy settings sees a peak in
demand for each of the fossil fuels before 2030. Some of the key changes in this Outlook
since the WEO-2022 are:


Faster growth in electric car sales. In this Outlook, the STEPS projections show more than
220 million electric passenger cars on the road in 2030, a 20% increase on the number
in the WEO-2022. This increase cuts oil demand in 2030 by around 1 mb/d and boosts
electricity demand from road transport by 165 TWh.



Continued momentum in renewables deployment. Higher interest rates and near-term
supply chain challenges create difficulties for some new projects, but overall our

Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

73

projections show further acceleration in deployment. Solar PV in particular rises more
quickly than in the WEO-2022, reflecting strengthened policies in a number of key
markets and ample solar PV manufacturing capacity (section 1.3). This results in lower
generation from coal and natural gas.
Slower economic growth and construction activity in China. This has an impact on the
projections for all fuels, but it has a particular effect on coal demand in China, which is
nearly 100 Mtce lower in 2030 than in the WEO-2022, with large reductions in power
and the steel and cement sectors (section 1.2).



Year-on-year revisions are important, but it is also useful to take a look at how projections
have evolved over a longer timeframe. Some of the largest changes in the STEPS over the
last five years have been in solar PV and wind generation and, particularly since the global
energy crisis, in natural gas demand. These are the focus of the following sections. We also
include insights on how the technology mix to reach net zero emissions by 2050 has evolved
in the NZE Scenario since it was introduced in 2021 (Box 1.3).
Box 1.3 ⊳

How does the 2023 NZE Scenario differ from the 2021 version?

The updated Net Zero by 2050 Roadmap, released by the IEA in September 2023,
achieves the same outcome as the original version from 2021 – limiting the rise in global
average temperatures to 1.5 °C – but the trajectory for emissions and the respective roles
of different fuels and technologies have changed (IEA, 2023b). This reflects a different
starting point for the scenario as well as bigger contributions from technologies that have
made good progress in recent years and smaller ones from those that have made more
limited progress.
Since 2021, demand for fossil fuels has risen. This partly reflects post-pandemic economic
growth and the effects of the global energy crisis, but it is also the result of a collective
failure to move more quickly to scale up clean energy investment in efficiency and supply.
This means that total energy demand, fossil fuel use and emissions in 2030 are higher
than in the 2021 version of the NZE Scenario.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Coal demand declines rapidly, but in 2030 it is nonetheless above the levels in the 2021
NZE Scenario. This reflects an attempt to provide a more manageable and equitable nearterm pathway for emerging market and developing economies, which dominate global
coal use, but it also stems in part from the energy security concerns around natural gas
sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This change means that the path to achieving
net zero emissions by 2050 in the 2023 NZE Scenario is a steeper one than in the 2021
version and requires more to be done after 2030, but the path remains open.
The balance of clean energy technologies used to achieve emissions reduction goals has
also shifted. Solar PV takes a more prominent role in the 2023 NZE Scenario, though
reductions in projected wind capacity additions mean that the combined 40% share of
wind and solar PV in total generation in 2030 is very similar to that projected in 2021.
74

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

This reflects the surge in solar PV installations and manufacturing capacity since the 2021
report. The rise in solar PV generation leads to a need for additional stationary battery
storage to ensure security of supply.
Electricity and electrification play even more prominent roles in the 2023 NZE Scenario
than they did in the 2021 version. This reflects a significant increase in EV sales and
progress in scaling up EV manufacturing supply chains. It also reflects accelerated
progress in heat pump deployment in buildings and rising market confidence in
technologies such as 100% electrolytic hydrogen-based direct reduced iron production.
Near-term deployment is slower for some technologies, notably wind, hydrogen and
CCUS. This reflects supply chain constraints, delays in scaling up project pipelines and
related infrastructure, and sluggish progress in the development of market frameworks
for less mature technologies. For some of these technologies, the downward revision is
based on recent investment trends from technology manufacturers compared with
investment in other low-emissions alternatives. So, for example, the 2023 Roadmap
foresees a reduced role for hydrogen-fuelled trucks.
The outlook for natural gas in the 2023 NZE Scenario has also changed since the first
version in 2021. In the 2021 Roadmap, natural gas use fell to 1 750 bcm in 2050; in this
Outlook, it falls to 920 bcm. Most of this 830 bcm difference in 2050 is because of lower
projected hydrogen production from natural gas with CCUS, with a larger role now
projected instead for hydrogen production via electrolysis.

1.10.1 Solar PV and wind generation

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The STEPS projections for solar PV and wind generation to 2030 have increased substantially
in successive editions of the Outlook since 2019 (Figure 1.34). Four main factors have been
at play:


Policies: The number of countries with policies that support expansion of solar PV and
wind has steadily risen, and now stands at over 140. At the same time, policy ambitions
and related support have been ratcheted up many times in major markets, including in
China, European Union, India, Japan and United States.



Cost reductions: Between 2010 and 2022, the levelised cost of electricity fell by about
90% for solar PV, 70% for onshore wind and 60% for offshore wind. Although there has
been a rise in costs in recent years (section 1.3) which has created difficulties in
particular for wind power in some advanced economies, these cost reductions have
largely followed anticipated learning rates linked to the scaling up of deployment and
technology innovation. In general, policy support and cost reductions have created a
virtuous cycle: increased policy support raised the level of deployment, which led to cost
reductions, and those cost reductions have led to additional deployment.

Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

75



Manufacturing capacity and industrial policies: IEA projections now fully account for
developments in clean energy supply chains, which in some cases have far outpaced
actual deployment and created an opportunity for further rapid increases, notably for
solar PV (section 1.3).



Financing conditions: Cost of capital for solar PV and wind power is especially important
because upfront capital costs account for the majority of their lifetime costs. Tried and
tested policy and regulatory frameworks have helped reduce financing costs by
providing operators with a high degree of revenue certainty, usually through long-term
contracts. Against this backdrop, today’s higher borrowing costs are a cause for concern
as they complicate project economics and could tilt cost calculations back towards
(often polluting) technologies that have lower upfront costs but lock in long-term
expenditure for fuel.

These factors have been very positive overall for the expansion of wind power and solar PV,
and help to explain year-on-year increases in projected deployment. However, the growth in
wind and solar PV generation to 2030 in the STEPS is far below the level needed to limit
warming to 1.5 °C, highlighting the urgent need for further measures to achieve the goals of
the NZE Scenario.

1.10.2 Natural gas
The STEPS scenarios that were modelled until the WEO-2021 projected strong continued
increases in natural gas consumption (Figure 1.35). Upward revisions to renewables
gradually narrowed the space for natural gas to contribute to electricity demand growth,
resulting in downward revisions to demand levels, but the long-term picture still supported
continued growth to 2040 and beyond.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The events of 2022 – especially the Russian invasion of Ukraine – led to a major revision in
the outlook for natural gas. There was an immediate cut in exports to Europe, and confidence
around the world was shaken in the ability of natural gas to act as a reliable and affordable
fuel. As a result, natural gas demand in 2040 was cut by around 570 bcm (12% reduction) in
the STEPS published in the WEO-2022. Around half of this reduction was due to a faster move
away from gas in advanced economies; the other half was the result of much slower
projected growth in emerging market and developing economies. Natural gas demand in
2040 has been adjusted down by a further 140 bcm in the STEPS in this Outlook. This mainly
reflects the upward revision to the outlook for renewables. Advanced economies, led by
Europe, account for around three-quarters of the overall downward revision in natural gas
demand.

Demand for LNG in 2050 in this Outlook is nearly 15% lower than projected in the STEPS of
the WEO-2021. This is a smaller reduction than the near 20% downward revision in overall
natural gas demand between the WEO-2021 and this Outlook. But the large increase in new
liquefaction projects approved for development in the intervening years means that planned
capacity is now sufficient to meet LNG demand in the STEPS to 2040, which is ten years later
than projected in the WEO-2021. This opens the prospect of looser market fundamentals,
lower prices and an easing of gas supply security concerns from the second-half of 2030s,
with potential upside for demand if these developments buttress confidence in gas among
price-sensitive emerging market and developing economies. However, it also raises
questions about the long-term profitability of projects.

Context and scenario design
S U M M A R Y
• There is a new context for this World Energy Outlook. A more complex and
fragmented geopolitical landscape has energy as one of its dividing lines. Partly as a
result, new energy and industrial policy settings are emerging as countries compete
for footholds in the new clean energy economy, amid concerns about energy security
and resilience. Greenhouse gas emissions remain at record levels and the
accumulation of emissions is heightening physical climate risks. And this is all taking
place in a difficult macroeconomic context, with the recent crisis pushing up the cost
of living and ending a period of low interest rates.

• Some of the tensions in energy markets have receded in 2023 after a period of
extended and extreme turbulence since 2020. However, numerous risks remain and
the current relative calm may not last. Continued fighting in Ukraine, more than a year
after Russia’s invasion, is now accompanied by the risk of protracted conflict in the
Middle East. Periods of extreme weather are becoming a major hazard for energy
security.

• Despite headwinds, there are strong signs of an acceleration in clean energy
transitions. The deployment trends for solar PV, electric vehicles, batteries and heat
pumps are encouraging and the overall balance of investment is shifting towards
clean energy. For every USD 1 spent on fossil fuels, USD 1.8 is now spent on a range
of clean energy technologies and related infrastructure: five years ago this ratio was
1:1. The increase in spending is concentrated in advanced economies and China. A
much broader flow of clean energy projects – based on stronger national policies and
international financial support – is essential to meet the Sustainable Development
Goals, including energy access, and global climate and energy security objectives.

• This Outlook explores three scenarios – fully updated – that provide a framework for
exploring the implications of various policy choices, investment and technology
trends. The Stated Policies Scenario is based on current policy settings and also
considers the implications of industrial policies that support clean energy supply
chains as well as measures related to energy and climate. The Announced Pledges
Scenario gives governments the benefit of the doubt and explores what the full and
timely implementation of national energy and climate goals, including net zero
emissions targets, would mean for the energy sector. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050
Scenario maps out a transition pathway that would limit global warming to 1.5 °C.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• The global economy is assumed to increase at an average of 2.6% per year to 2050 in
the three scenarios, while the global population expands from 8 billion today to
9.7 billion in 2050. Energy, carbon and mineral prices find different equilibrium levels
across the scenarios, but the potential for volatility remains high.

New context for the World Energy Outlook

The energy sector has been shaken in recent years, first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then
by the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both were hugely
disruptive. Both had impacts on energy markets that left many energy producers and
consumers feeling bruised by volatile fuel and electricity prices.
These impacts prompted a range of reactions from policy makers to try and lessen the
immediate impacts and address future vulnerabilities, including risks to energy security and
affordability, while at the same time facing up to the imperative to transition to clean energy
technologies. Whether these responses are adequate to the scale of the challenge is the
central question of this Outlook. When future generations look back, will the extended crisis
of 2020-2023 be seen as the moment when the world took decisive steps to address the
multiple risks facing the energy sector, or will the reaction to it be seen as another missed
opportunity?
Some key trends in 2023 underscore the persistence of the status quo. By mid-year, many
indicators of fossil fuel demand were returning to where they had been prior to the
pandemic. Natural gas demand rebounded to 2019 levels in 2021, and is now holding steady
after a tumultuous 2022. Global demand for all oil products took a little longer to come back,
but has also now returned to 2019 levels, with aviation fuels the last to bounce back. And
coal demand dipped during the pandemic but then reached a new record level in 2022.

Following a period of extreme volatility, fossil fuel prices moderated in the first half of 2023
although market balances remain fragile (Figure 2.1). Crude oil prices returned above
USD 90/barrel in September 2023, as major producers in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries-plus (OPEC+) grouping enacted cuts to their production. After the
extraordinary price spikes of 2022 that saw natural gas regularly trading in Europe at prices
above USD 50 per million British thermal units (MBtu) – the equivalent of more than
USD 250/barrel of oil – European prices settled back at around USD 10/MBtu, though these
prices were still high compared with those seen over the past decade. After record high
prices of over USD 400/tonne a year earlier, steam coal prices were back down below
USD 150/tonne.
Does this mean that the period of crisis is behind us? And that the energy sector has reverted
to the same pathway that it was on before? Neither of these propositions appear to be true.
Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East mean a high risk of further
disruption and upheaval. And the energy pathway now looks different. There are
unmistakeable signs in many parts of the world of a major acceleration in the pace of energy
transitions, even if macroeconomic conditions have become more challenging.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

These various changes, and the reactions to them, mean that there is a new context for this
World Energy Outlook:


The future will take shape within a more fragmented geopolitical and security context.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has widened fractures in the landscape of international
relations, and energy is one of the dividing lines. With flows of Russian energy to Europe
now at very low levels, one of the main traditional corridors for international energy
trade has been closed, leading to a wholesale realignment in the way that fuels move
around the world. In a more fractured geopolitical environment, policy makers tend to
view many energy developments through an energy security lens. This does not
disadvantage clean technologies; in many cases they provide solutions to energy
security concerns. But it puts a premium on orderly and secure change and it has also
meant that, as policy makers look beyond the immediate natural gas crisis, attention has
focused on dependencies in clean energy supply chains, which exhibit significantly
higher levels of concentration in many cases than supplies of oil and natural gas.



Government responses to the energy crisis are set to have long-term implications for
energy and industrial policy. In some cases, responses have included efforts to develop
fossil fuel resources. But in general the emphasis has been on measures to fast-track the
deployment of clean energy, as with the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States,
more ambitious near-term targets and support measures in Europe, and strong support
for clean energy in China, India and Brazil, among others. A world of more pronounced
international rivalries has also produced a renewed focus on industrial strategies. These
typically seek to promote investment in domestic production and/or supply from
favoured jurisdictions as a way to increase the resilience of supply chains and to benefit
from new jobs and economic opportunities. Clean energy has been a major focus for

82

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

these industrial strategies as countries compete for footholds in the new clean energy
economy. These various strategies are integrated into our World Energy Outlook-2023
(WEO) scenario design.


Emissions continue to accumulate in the atmosphere with all that this implies for
climate-related risks. Between the beginning of 2019 and the end of 2022, the global
energy system was responsible for more than 140 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2)
emissions (Figure 2.2). This means that the world is racing through the available budget
that is compatible with limiting the rise in global average temperatures to 1.5 degree
Celsius (°C). These additional emissions are contributing to more frequent heatwaves,
droughts and other extreme weather events that add to the pressure on vulnerable
populations and energy systems.



The macroeconomic background has become more difficult with inflationary pressures
in 2022 marking the end of an era of very cheap capital and low interest rates. Many
emerging market and developing economies are particularly disadvantaged by higher
borrowing costs and rising fiscal pressures. According to the World Bank, incomes per
capita in 2024 will remain below 2019 levels in more than one-third of low income
countries (World Bank, 2023a). Higher borrowing costs risk putting some clean energy
projects at a disadvantage relative to traditional energy investments because the latter
have lower upfront costs, even though the clean energy projects may be more cost
effective over time since they do not depend on fossil fuel inputs.

Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

2.1.1

New clean energy economy

The energy crisis has brought forward the emergence of a new clean energy economy.
Market turbulence prompted a short-term scramble for alternative fossil fuel supplies,
particularly after Russia cut natural gas deliveries to Europe, but it also significantly increased
capital flows and associated investments that support structural transformation of the
energy system.
Prior to the pandemic, annual investment in energy systems was just over USD 2 trillion, split
roughly in equal parts between fossil fuels and clean energy (the latter includes renewables,
other low-emissions sources of generation and fuels, and spending on efficiency
improvements, end-use electrification, grids and storage). The IEA estimate for 2023 is that
around USD 2.8 trillion is set to be invested in the energy sector (IEA, 2023a). Fossil fuel
spending has been rising slowly after a sharp drop in 2020 but remains roughly where it was
five years ago, so all of the increase has come from clean energy (Figure 2.3). The trends are
far from uniform across technologies, but growth in some key clean energy technology areas,
notably solar photovoltaics (PV), is now aligned with the near-term requirements of the IEA
Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, which limits global warming to 1.5 °C.
The emergence of the new clean energy economy is starting to change the face of the energy
system. Our analysis in the World Energy Outlook-2022 highlighted that the policy and
market trends reflected in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), were already strong enough
to deliver a peak in global fossil fuel demand by the end of the 2020s. Updated projections
in this World Energy Outlook-2023 underscore this conclusion and bring in new points of
reference to support it.

The most dynamic areas can be grouped under the heading of clean electrification. This is
underpinned by investment in low-emissions technologies: annual global renewable
electricity capacity additions are set to rise to more than 500 gigawatts (GW) in 2023, the
largest absolute increase ever seen. The share of low-emissions generation sources
(renewables plus nuclear) in the global mix is set to reach 40% in 2023 – a new high.
Solar is leading the charge: solar PV capacity, including both large utility-scale and small
distributed systems, accounts for two-thirds of the 2023 estimated increase in global
renewable capacity. The 26% annual growth in solar generation in 2022 was aligned with the
near-term rates required in the NZE Scenario, and planned additions provide confidence that
high growth can be sustained.
Nuclear capacity additions grew by 40% in 2022, with 8 GW coming online, mostly in China,
Finland, Korea and Pakistan. Moreover, many governments are taking a fresh look at how
nuclear might contribute to their energy futures, as they did after the oil price shocks of the
1970s.
Electricity is expanding to new end-uses at scale, notably to provide mobility and heat.
Global electric vehicle (EV) sales jumped by more than 50% in 2022, reaching a record high
of more than 10 million. Deployment of utility-scale and behind-the-meter battery storage
grew by 90% in 2022, while heat pumps also saw a record year with sales up 11%, almost
double the level of five years ago.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Clean electrification is being complemented by a renewed focus on efficiency. Countries
representing more than 70% of global energy consumption have introduced new or
strengthened efficiency policies since the start of the energy crisis. The European Union
agreed on stronger rules in March 2023 which nearly double the rate of annual savings that
EU member countries need to deliver between 2024 and 2030; the United States raised the
level of support offered to households for efficiency upgrades; China stepped up its push to
increase industrial energy efficiency; and India passed new efficiency laws that reinforce
building energy codes and appliance standards, while also promoting sustainable choices via
its Lifestyle for Environment Initiative domestically and at the Group of 20 (G20).
Progress is advancing most rapidly in areas where technologies are already mature and cost
competitive, such as electricity generation and passenger transport. But a full clean energy
transition will require progress in all areas, including those where emissions are harder to
address. This necessitates policy support for innovation and early deployment. New
initiatives and programmes are now in place for fuels such as low-emissions hydrogen and
technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Investment in these
areas is rising from a low base and only a handful of projects have yet made it over the line:
only 4% of announced projects for low-emissions hydrogen have taken a final investment
decision. However, policy makers are now looking at ways to provide greater certainty on
demand, increase clarity on certification and regulation, and stimulate new infrastructure to
allow more projects to progress to the implementation phase.

Analysis prepared by the IEA for the 2023 Group of Seven (G7) Leaders Summit in Hiroshima,
Japan, highlighted the impressive growth in manufacturing capacity announcements in
recent months (IEA, 2023b). If all announced projects were to come to fruition, solar PV
manufacturing capacity would comfortably exceed the deployment needs of the
NZE Scenario in 2030. Moreover, if they all proceed, announced projects for EV battery
manufacturing capacity could cover virtually all of the 2030 global deployment needs
identified in the NZE Scenario. The world is still a long way from a trajectory for emissions
that is consistent with the Paris Agreement and the 1.5 °C target, but the pace of change in
some key areas is impressive.

2.1.2

Uneasy balance for oil, natural gas and coal markets

Oil markets faced two major short-term uncertainties at the start of 2023: the strength of
the recovery in demand in China as the economy emerged from the Covid-19 lockdowns, and
the impact on energy supply from Russia due to the price cap imposed by a G7-led coalition
on Russian exports of crude oil and refined products. As of mid-year 2023, the recovery of
demand in China has been quite strong. Despite slowing of its economic recovery, China is
expected to account for well over half of global oil demand growth in 2023. And Russian
production and exports continue to find buyers around the world, although its revenues have
been considerably lower than a year earlier. Growth in oil demand is being driven by a
handful of segments, notably aviation fuels. Concerns about weaker demand and prices have
prompted a series of output cuts from Saudi Arabia and other members of the OPEC+
grouping.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Natural gas markets have moved towards a gradual rebalancing after the shocks of recent
years. High inventory levels at storage sites in key Asian and European markets provide
grounds for cautious optimism ahead of the 2023-2024 winter heating season in the
northern hemisphere that markets will be calmer than in recent years, but major
uncertainties remain. Relatively mild weather and restrained demand from China lessened
the disruptive impact of Russian cuts to its European deliveries in 2021-2022, and it cannot
be taken for granted that this will be the case in the coming winter. Markets remain
vulnerable to unexpected outages or disruptions, especially for countries dependent on spot
markets for supply.
As with oil, patterns of natural gas trade have changed dramatically as a result of the global
gas crisis. A striking indicator of a reshaped global gas market is that liquefied natural gas
(LNG) has now become a base source of supply for Europe, with its share in total demand in
the European Union rising from an average of 12% over the 2010s to close to 35% in 2022,
similar to the contribution from piped gas from Russia before its invasion of Ukraine. This has
knock-on effects on all aspects of natural gas markets and on how countries collaborate to
ensure gas security. A number of new liquefaction projects have received the green light
since 2022, adding to the wave of new LNG supply scheduled to start operation in the second
half of this decade.

86

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Box 2.1 ⊳

How did the European Union make up for a triple deficit of
natural gas in 2022?

Analysis of the global energy crisis tends to focus on the cuts in Russian gas deliveries to
the European Union from mid-2022 as the trigger. The 80 billion cubic metre (bcm) drop
in pipeline supplies from Russia was indeed a primary cause of market turbulence, both
in Europe and further afield. But it was not the only one. Changes in Russian behaviour
in gas markets began well before its invasion of Ukraine, and Gazprom was much slower
than usual to refill its European gas storage in the third-quarter 2021. The call on the tight
gas market was exacerbated even further by a very poor year for both hydropower and
nuclear output in Europe in 2022. Overall, this triple deficit meant that there was almost
160 bcm of “missing gas” to replace in 2022 (Figure 2.4).
Alternative sources of supply met over 40% of the deficit, with LNG from the United
States making by far the largest contribution. Europe’s ability to source supply was
greatly facilitated by lower demand in China, but nonetheless caused significant pain for
other import-dependent economies that found themselves outcompeted for available
supply. However, the main adjustments were made on the demand side. Gas use in
industry fell by almost 25%, over half of which was the result of curtailment in energyintensive industries (with few signs in 2023 of a meaningful recovery). The oft-discussed
mild winter accounted for some 10% of the overall deficit, which was around the same
as the combined contribution from new renewable capacity and efficiency
improvements. Contrary to the perception that coal played a significant role, additional
coal consumption filled less than 4% of the gap.

Oil and gas investment has been affected by uncertainties concerning future demand. It is
striking that, despite record revenues in 2022, spending on oil and gas production is one of
the few investment indicators that remains below pre-crisis levels (coal supply investments,
for example, are higher than they were in 2019). In terms of our scenarios, current oil and
gas spending is broadly aligned with the levels required in the STEPS in 2030, but well above
the levels required to meet much lower demand in the NZE Scenario.
Coal demand has been on an elevated plateau and reached a record level in 2022 as higher
demand in India, China and Southeast Asia more than offset declines in the United States. In
Europe, coal consumption increased by 2% during the energy crisis, with lower industrial
consumption balancing out growth in coal use for power generation. Early signs in 2023
suggest continued increases in coal consumption in many parts of Asia, accompanied by
significant falls in demand in North America and also in Europe as the latter resumes precrisis trends. Increases in coal consumption are being accompanied by increases in coal
production in the three largest coal producers – China, India and Indonesia – with both China
and India reaching new monthly production highs in March 2023.

2.1.3

Key challenges for secure and just clean energy transitions

Even as clean energy transitions gather pace, IEA analysis has highlighted four key areas that
require urgent attention if the world is to see orderly but rapid change. These are recurring
themes in this Outlook.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

First is a crucial concern that a disproportionately low share of clean energy investment is
going to emerging market and developing economies other than China. With a few
exceptions, such as investment in solar PV in India, the level of spending on clean energy in
these countries in recent years, at less than USD 250 billion per year, is far out of line with
what is required to meet rising energy needs in a sustainable way. As things stand, countries
accounting for nearly two-thirds of the world’s population account for only 15% of global
clean energy investment (Figure 2.5). Bringing down the cost of capital by tackling a host of
real and perceived risks associated with these investments and increasing the availability of
capital, both domestic and international, is an essential step towards improving the situation.
Expansion of clean energy investment is a precondition not only to achieve universal access
to modern energy but also to deliver on other United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals in areas as diverse as poverty reduction, health and education. Exposure to volatile
energy prices in many developing economies has been accompanied by major concerns
about food security caused in part by high fuel and fertiliser prices, and higher debt burdens
and fiscal pressures. The drive to provide universal access to modern energy has slowed in
recent years and even reversed in some places: 775 million people still lack access to
electricity worldwide and 2.2 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels. This Outlook
marks the mid-point of the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, adopted in 2015. In most cases, the world is well short of halfway to reaching
its 2030 goals.

Second is the challenge of uneven progress being made across different areas of technology
and infrastructure. Deployment trends for some technologies are sufficiently fast to be
aligned with the IEA NZE Scenario, but the trends for most are not. Of the 50 technologies
and cross-cutting areas assessed as part of the IEA Tracking Clean Energy Progress, only three
were evaluated as fully on track: solar PV, EVs and efficient lighting (IEA, 2023c). Most require
additional efforts to get on track: these include wind power, grids and storage, electrolysers,
efficiency, innovation and digitalisation. And some are definitively off track, including those
needed for long-distance transportation by truck, air and ship and those needed by many
large industrial sub-sectors.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Reaching net zero emissions will clearly require progress across the board, and there are
multiple commercial, technical, policy and supply chain issues to resolve. The risk with an
uneven pace of progress is that slower moving elements may determine the overall pace of
change. Grid availability, which is already hindering growth in renewables-based generation
in some markets, is a case in point. At least 3 000 GW of renewable power projects, of which
1 500 GW are in advanced stages, are waiting in grid connection queues – equivalent to five
times the amount of solar PV and wind capacity added in 2022 (IEA, 2023d).
Maintaining rapid rates of renewables deployment requires broadly matched progress across
all the interlinked parts of the energy system, including grids, storage and dispatchable lowemissions sources of generation. Without such progress, the flexible and secure operation of
power systems as a whole inevitably will be impaired. Complementary measures can also
Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

89

play an important part to facilitate rapid increases in low-emissions power. For example,
improvements in energy efficiency, particularly for rapidly increasing demand areas such as
space cooling, can alleviate strains on systems and obviate the need for expensive supplyside investment to meet peak demand levels, while reforms to electricity market structures
and pricing can help consumers to benefit from the lower operational costs of renewables.
A third key area is to mitigate new energy security vulnerabilities in a rapidly changing
energy system. Traditional concerns about fuel security do not disappear in energy
transitions, and rapid deployment of clean energy technologies requires resilience along a
new set of supply chains. For example, the manufacturing process for EVs depends on steel
(which in the future will be required to be near zero emissions steel) and other materials,
and ultimately on the minerals and ores needed to produce them, plus anodes and cathodes
for battery supply. Each step of the process has different lead times and involves specific
challenges.
Clean energy supply chains today are highly concentrated. China has an outsized presence.
It has huge shares of global manufacturing capacity for solar PV modules and batteries (75%)
as well as a very strong position in the refining and processing of critical minerals. In the last
year, major policy announcements indicate developments that will diversify some supply
chains, as evidenced by the scale-up in planned battery manufacturing capacity in the United
States following the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act. Yet, levels of supply chain
concentration look likely to remain high. This makes the entire system vulnerable to
unforeseen changes that could arise due to shifts in national policies, commercial strategies,
technical failures or natural hazards.
A fourth key area is the need to ensure people-centred transitions. Inclusive approaches are
essential to ensure that the benefits of clean energy transitions are felt widely across
societies, and to maintain their political acceptability. The turbulent events of recent years
clearly point to the risks and costs that arise if the process of change is disorderly or
disjointed, or if vulnerable groups within societies are left behind. During the global energy
crisis in 2022, governments allocated an extra USD 900 billion to shield consumers from the
impact of spiralling energy prices, around a quarter of which was specifically directed to low
income households and the hardest hit industries. Further measures will be needed to enable
the least well-off to invest in clean and more efficient energy technologies for household use,
especially where these technologies entail higher initial capital outlay than fossil fuel
equivalents, even though they offer lower operating costs.

WEO scenarios

This Outlook employs three main scenarios to explore different pathways for the energy
sector to 2050. Each scenario is fully updated to include the most recent available energy
market and cost data. Each scenario responds in different ways to the fundamental economic
and demographic drivers of rising demand for energy services. These differences largely
90

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

reflect the various policy choices assumed to be made by governments, which, in turn, shape
investment decisions and the ways in which households and companies satisfy their energy
needs.
The projections are derived from the Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model, which is a
large-scale modelling framework developed at the International Energy Agency (IEA). The
model matches energy demand and supply across multiple countries and regions, taking
account of a very wide range of fuels and energy technologies, including not only those that
are widely available today, but also those that are judged to be approaching
commercialisation. The GEC Model is a simulation model that reflects the real‐world
interplay between policies, costs and investment choices and which provides insights into
how changes in one area may affect others.
None of the scenarios included in this Outlook should be considered a forecast. The intention
is not to guide the reader towards a single view of the future, but rather to promote a deeper
understanding of the way that various levers produce diverse outcomes, and the implications
of different courses of action for the security and sustainability of the energy system.
An important element of this Outlook is that all scenarios now take into account not only
energy and climate-related policies but also industrial strategies that affect the rate at which
different technologies might enter the mix. This means that the scale and location of
manufacturing capacity for various components of the clean energy system have become
important variables in scenario construction and design.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The scenarios are:


Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario: This normative scenario portrays a pathway
for the energy sector to help limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C above pre‐
industrial levels in 2100 (with at least a 50% probability) with limited overshoot. The NZE
Scenario has been fully updated and is the focus of the recently released Net Zero
Roadmap: A Global Pathway to Keep the 1.5 °C Goal in Reach (IEA, 2023d). The
NZE Scenario also meets the key energy‐related UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs): universal access to reliable modern energy services is reached by 2030, and
major improvements in air quality are secured. Each passing year of high emissions and
limited progress towards the SDGs makes achieving the goals of the NZE Scenario more
difficult but, based on our analysis, the recent acceleration in clean energy transitions
means that there is still a pathway open to achieving its goals.



Announced Pledges Scenario (APS): This scenario assumes that governments will meet,
in full and on time, all of the climate‐related commitments that they have announced,
including longer term net zero emissions targets and pledges in Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs), as well as commitments in related areas such as energy access.
Pledges made by businesses and other stakeholders are also taken into account where
they add to the ambition set out by governments. Since most governments are still very
far from having policies announced or in place to deliver in full on their commitments
and pledges, this scenario could be regarded as giving them the benefit of the doubt,

Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

91

2

and very considerable progress would have to be made for it to be achieved. Countries
without ambitious long-term pledges are assumed to benefit in this scenario from the
accelerated cost reductions that it produces for a range of clean energy technologies.
The APS is associated with a temperature rise of 1.7 °C in 2100 (with a 50% probability).


Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS): This scenario is designed to provide a sense of the
prevailing direction of energy system progression, based on a detailed review of the
current policy landscape. Whereas the APS reflects what governments say they will
achieve, the STEPS looks in detail at what they are actually doing to reach their targets
and objectives across the energy economy. Outcomes in the STEPS reflect a detailed
sector-by-sector review of the policies and measures that are actually in place or that
have been announced; aspirational energy or climate targets are not automatically
assumed to be met. The STEPS is now associated with a temperature rise of 2.4 °C in
2100 (with a 50% probability).

2.2.1

Policies

Energy and climate policies
A crucial preparatory step for every annual edition of Outlook is the review and assessment
of new policies, regulatory measures, targets and announcements that might affect the
evolution of the energy system. The recent global energy crisis has spurred a wide range of
energy and climate policy responses and initiatives that are now incorporated into the
scenarios. The US Inflation Reduction Act and other notable new policies that were taken
into account in the WEO-2022 remain important points of reference.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The review covers all types of policies that have a bearing on energy systems, including
decisions to proceed with new oil and gas licensing rounds, methane reduction action plans,
and initiatives and strategies for energy access. The initial years of the scenario projections
are also informed by the detailed databases that the IEA maintains for various types of
announced or planned energy projects.
For example, over the last year the European Union stepped up its climate ambition with
new targets for renewables and energy efficiency. It reformed the EU Emissions Trading
System (ETS) and established a new ETS for the buildings and road transport sectors. Further,
it introduced a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that will levy a price on
carbon embedded in imported products in selected sectors, and also increased emissions
reduction targets for sectors not covered by an ETS. Japan established a roadmap for its
Green Transformation (GX) programme that aims to raise the share of renewables and
nuclear in power generation and to ensure that all new private cars sold are low-emissions
vehicles by 2035. GX will be supported by carbon pricing and sovereign GX transition bonds.
Canada, in its 2023 federal budget, allocated significant funding to accelerate the
deployment of clean energy technologies and to decarbonise large emitters. Indonesia,
Viet Nam and Senegal signed Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETP), in which they
committed to accelerate the decarbonisation of their respective power sectors. South Africa
also published its JETP investment plans.
92

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Industrial policies
Many countries are putting specific policies in place to encourage clean energy
manufacturing. Our scenarios now take account of these policies in association with costs,
targets and other variables for modelling and calibrating deployment trends.
China has a very high share of current manufacturing capacity across a range of technologies.
Following the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, the United States has put
in place a range of tax credits and federal support for investment in clean energy
manufacturing, with a focus on renewables, low-emissions hydrogen, CCUS, EVs, clean
energy manufacturing and critical minerals. Canada has also established funding and tax
credit support mechanisms for critical minerals, clean energy technologies and clean energy
manufacturing. The European Union adopted a Green Deal Industrial Plan that targets
increased public and private investment in clean technology manufacturing, and the
European Commission proposed a Critical Raw Materials Act with benchmarks for domestic
extraction, processing and recycling. Other countries have moved in a similar direction, with
the notable example of India’s production-linked incentive scheme to boost battery and solar
PV manufacturing capacity.

2.2.2

Economic and demographic assumptions

In each of the three scenarios, the global economy is assumed to grow by 2.6% per year on
average over the period to 2050. This is broadly in line with trend growth, but varies by
country and by region and over time, reflecting investment dynamics, employment rates and
changes in terms of trade (Table 2.1).
We hold the assumed rates of economic growth constant across scenarios to allow for a
comparison of the effects of different energy and climate choices against a common
backdrop. However, we recognise that the pace, design and choice of policy and regulatory
mechanisms used to drive change in the energy system will have wider economic impacts –
both positive and negative – across countries and regions.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The initial years in the Outlook are shaped by countries’ exposure and resilience to shocks
and by where they are currently positioned in the economic cycle. The reverberations from
the pandemic and the global energy crisis are being felt across the broader economy as
household purchasing power is eroded by higher inflation and as business investment is
restrained by rising borrowing costs (although clean energy appears, in some cases, to be
bucking this trend). Notwithstanding, labour market conditions remain relatively buoyant:
the unemployment rate is at or near its lowest level in half a century in most countries, and
this is helping to support household income and economic activity. Global GDP growth over
the period to 2030 is projected to average 3%.
The near-term economic outlooks published by international organisations, such as the
International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, emphasise the significant uncertainty and the downside risks that pervade
GDP growth and inflation projections. One key risk is that inflation could be more persistent

than expected, prompting further hikes in interest rates with uncertain consequences in
financial markets, notably in emerging market and developing economies.

Population is a major determinant of many of the trends in the Outlook. We use the medium
variant of the United Nations World Population Prospects, where the global population is
assumed to rise from 8 billion people in 2022 to 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050.
Population growth in the medium variant is not linear, and the rate of growth slows over
time.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Demographic trends differ by country and region. Ageing populations and slowing fertility
rates mean the size of the population in 2050 is expected to be smaller than today in the
European Union, Russia, Japan and China. In contrast, the United Nations projects a billion
more people in Africa by 2050, accounting for three-fifths of the global population increase.
India’s population has now overtaken that of China and is projected to reach almost
1.7 billion by 2050, some 360 million people more than in China (UN DESA, 2022).
In the past, the development of economies has typically been associated with the migration
of rural workers to towns and cities in search of better paying jobs. This pattern of
development is assumed to continue over the period to 2050. In fact, in most regions the
94

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

change in the population is entirely concentrated in urban areas. Only Africa is expected to
experience an increase in the size of its rural population by the middle of the century, and
even there it is dwarfed by a much larger increase in the urban population (Figure 2.6). In the
Asia Pacific region, more than 400 million people move from rural areas to towns and cities
by 2050. If the model of urban development remains broadly as it is now, this global increase
in the urban population will have major consequences for the energy outlook, not least by
increasing demand for construction materials, such as steel and concrete.

2.2.3

Energy, critical mineral and carbon prices

Oil prices

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In each of the three scenarios, oil and natural gas prices act as intermediaries between supply
and demand to ensure that sources of supply meet changes in demand and hold the energy
system in equilibrium (Table 2.2). This balancing act means prices in our scenarios follow
relatively smooth trajectories. We do not try to anticipate the price cycles that characterise
commodity markets in practice, but we recognise that the potential for oil and gas price
volatility is ever present, especially given the profound changes that are needed to meet the
world’s climate goals.
In the STEPS, the slight but steady decline in demand from the late 2020s keeps the oil price
in check. Falling supply from existing fields, however, means there is not a large overall
reduction in price. A number of major resource-holders have pursued active market

management strategies in recent years to keep prices higher than they would otherwise be.
It is assumed that they will seek to continue to do so, meaning the marginal project is more
expensive than implied by the global supply-cost curve alone.

Steam coal (USD/tonne)

Notes: MBtu = million British thermal units. The IEA crude oil price is a weighted average import price among
IEA member countries. Natural gas prices are weighted averages expressed on a gross calorific-value basis.
The US natural gas price reflects the wholesale price prevailing on the domestic market. The European Union
and China natural gas prices reflect a balance of pipeline and LNG imports, while the Japan gas price is solely
LNG imports. The LNG prices used are those at the customs border, prior to regasification. Steam coal prices
are weighted averages adjusted to 6 000 kilocalories per kilogramme. The US steam coal price reflects mine
mouth prices plus transport and handling costs. Coastal China steam coal price reflects a balance of imports
and domestic sales, while the European Union and Japan steam coal prices are solely for imports.

In the APS, the policy focus on curbing oil and gas demand brings down the prices at which
the market finds equilibrium from levels in 2022: the international oil price falls to around
USD 60/barrel in 2050. In the NZE Scenario, oil and gas prices quickly fall to the costs of the
marginal project required to meet falling demand, which is around USD 40/barrel for oil in
2030, before declining further to USD 25/barrel in 2050. These prices cover the operating
expenses to lift oil and gas out of the field of the marginal producer, the capital expenditure
and operating cost required in emissions reduction technologies, as well as upstream taxes.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Natural gas prices
In the STEPS, natural gas prices stay somewhat elevated relative to pre-crisis levels until the
middle of the decade as global gas markets continue to adjust following the loss of Russian
pipeline gas supply to Europe, a loss that is assumed to be permanent. However, a wave of
new LNG export capacity from 2025 eases gas market balances, and Asian markets take back
the designation of premium market for LNG. As natural gas demand first plateaus and then
decreases in the STEPS after 2030, import prices stay around USD 8/MBtu. In the United
States, natural gas prices average around USD 4/MBtu due to domestic production of gas.
96

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

In the APS, a sharper reduction in European natural gas demand softens prices further. Lower
gas demand growth in emerging market and developing economies and fierce competition
among LNG suppliers to capture market share means that by 2030, prices for natural gas
importers tend towards the range between USD 6.5/MBtu and USD 8/MBtu. In the NZE
Scenario, a glut of gas supply forms in the mid-2020s as demand starts to decline rapidly in
key markets, and prices in China, Japan and the European Union fall to levels last seen at the
height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. This puts a strain on export projects at the margin,
especially for the 40% of export projects that have not yet recovered their invested capital.

Coal prices
Robust coal supply and lower natural gas prices sent coal prices steeply downward towards
the end of 2022, easing an unprecedented period of market tightness. High prices during the
energy crisis in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine had previously strengthened the
balance sheets of coal mining companies, providing them with an opportunity to invest in
maintaining and, in some cases, expanding capacity. However, our scenarios offer a mixed
picture, at best, for future demand and prices. The STEPS offers some comfort to coal
producers, at least in the near term, but demand falls in all scenarios, and prices decline
towards the operating costs of existing mines: the decline is fastest in the NZE Scenario.

Critical mineral prices
Reliable and sustainable supplies of critical minerals and metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt
and copper are fundamental to keep clean energy transitions affordable. Vigorous
deployment of clean energy technologies has made the energy sector the main driver of
growth in the critical minerals market (IEA, 2023f). After a surge in prices of these critical
minerals in 2021 and 2022, prices have started to moderate, but in most cases, they remain
significantly above historical averages (Figure 2.7). We do not yet model full long-term
supply-demand balances for critical minerals in the same way as for fuels, but we do
undertake market monitoring and scenario benchmarking. Based on this analysis, we expect
medium-term markets for many energy transition minerals to remain under pressure as the
economy recovers and clean energy deployment continues to accelerate.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Delays or cost overruns remain a significant possibility for many announced supply projects,
and uncertainty about the future availability of higher specification battery-grade products
remains a source of concern. New critical mineral projects generally involve higher
production costs: there is a long list of potential plays that require elevated marginal costs
to bring volumes on stream ranging from lepidolite-based lithium and to sulfidic-based
copper. In addition, supply-side events may induce short-term price pressures: in early 2023
there were mine supply disruptions in Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and Peru (the result of
unusually heavy rain in Brazil and Indonesia), plus aluminium production in China was
disrupted by hydropower shortages.

Carbon prices

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Globally, about 23% of energy-related emissions are now covered by a carbon price of some
type. Despite the global energy crisis and significant price volatility in energy markets, carbon
prices increased in 2022 in about half of the existing carbon pricing schemes, several new
instruments were launched, and others extended their scope. The European Union
significantly increased the ambition of its ETS and adopted a new emissions trading system
for the buildings, road transport and other industry sectors, while also introducing a CBAM
which will levy a price on carbon embedded in imported products in selected sectors. China
increased the stringency of its national ETS. Indonesia announced the launch of its own ETS
for the power sector. India introduced framework legislation to develop a national carbon
market. The government in Brazil proposed draft legislation for a national ETS. Revenues
generated from emissions trading systems and carbon taxes continue on an upward trend,
with almost USD 100 billion generated in 2022 (World Bank, 2023b). Nevertheless, most
carbon prices remain below the level that we estimate is needed if the goals of the
Paris Agreement are to be met.
In our scenarios, the STEPS incorporates existing and scheduled carbon pricing initiatives,
whereas the APS and the NZE Scenario include additional measures of varying stringency and
scope. In the NZE Scenario, for example, carbon prices are quickly established in all regions,
98

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

rising by 2050 to an average of USD 250/tonne CO2 in advanced economies, and
USD 200/tonne CO2 in other major economies, e.g. China, Brazil, India and South Africa, with
lower price levels elsewhere. As with other policy measures, carbon prices should be
introduced only with careful attention to the likely consequences and distributional impacts.
The level of carbon prices included in our scenarios should be interpreted with caution: the
scenarios include a number of other energy policies and accompanying measures designed
to reduce CO2 emissions, and this means that the carbon prices shown are not the marginal
costs of abatement (as is often the case in other modelling approaches).

2.2.4

Technology costs

After an unbroken run of cost declines, prices for some key clean energy technologies rose
in 2021 and 2022, largely reflecting higher input prices for critical minerals, semiconductors
and bulk materials such as steel and cement. This has had negative effects in the short term
on the financial performance of some major clean technology suppliers and project
developers. Nevertheless, the prices of all clean energy technologies today are significantly
lower than a decade ago: they remain competitive with fossil fuel alternatives. Signs are
evident in 2023 that some of the cost pressures are easing, although the risk of tight supply
chains for key components remains. Overall, we consider that clean energy technology costs
will continue to trend downward, and that there is still considerable scope to reduce
important cost elements through technology innovation, materials substitution, efficiency
improvements and economies of scale.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The GEC Model used to generate our scenario projections includes a very broad
representation of energy technologies. The costs of these technologies evolve over time in
the scenarios as a result of continued research, improvements in manufacturing and
learning-by-doing. These costs are linked in turn to levels of deployment. The link works in
both directions: lower costs tend to mean higher levels of deployment, and higher levels of
deployment tend to reduce costs. The cost reductions are not linear: a typical curve will be
steepest in the earliest phases of innovation and deployment (when overall costs are still
high), and much flatter once technologies are mature. Policies play a crucial role in this
process, particularly in determining how quickly innovative clean technologies are scaled up
in sectors such as shipping, aviation and heavy industry.
Innovation also has an impact on the projected costs of fossil fuel supply, but here the
downward pressure from technology learning is offset by the effects of moving to more
geologically challenging or remote deposits as cheaper and easier resources are gradually
depleted. There are also offsetting pressures in the case of some clean technologies, for
example, new sites for onshore wind may be less favourable in terms of wind speeds than
those already in operation, and new sites for mining critical minerals for battery
manufacturing may involve higher production costs. But overall technology cost trends point
in the direction of increasingly stiff competition for fossil fuels from clean energy
technologies across a wide range of market segments.

a quarterly basis with 2019 Q4 defined as 100. Nominal prices.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The speed at which new technologies enter the energy system is particularly important in
the NZE Scenario, which relies on an extremely rapid pace of innovation in areas such as new
battery chemistries, carbon dioxide removal technologies and ammonia to fuel for ships. This
requires governments to give a high priority to research, development, demonstration and
deployment activities in these areas, especially at a time when capital markets are becoming
more expensive to access. There are some positive signs in recent policy announcements
that this is happening, although the collaboration that usually plays an important part in
accelerating knowledge transfer and supporting rapid diffusion of new technologies cannot
be taken for granted, especially in today’s fractious international context.

Chapter 3
Pathways for the energy mix
A view with a peak
S U M M A R Y
• 2022 was a turbulent year for global energy markets, with energy prices – notably for
natural gas – skyrocketing in Europe and many other parts of the world. The effects
of the price shock on consumers were cushioned to a large extent by government
interventions. Global energy demand rose 1.3% in line with its recent average.

• Despite geopolitical friction, volatile commodity prices and uncertainty around costs,
transformative changes in parts of the global energy system are coming into view.
Electric vehicles (EVs) account for around 15% of car sales today, and are on course
to reach a share of 40% by 2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). A record
220 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity was added in 2022, and deployment levels are
projected to more than double, while heat pumps more than double their share of
heating equipment sales in the STEPS by 2030. The planned boost in the
manufacturing capacity of these clean energy technologies, if fully realised, appears
able to meet many of the deployment milestones in the Announced Pledges Scenario
(APS) and, in the case of solar and batteries, also to provide what is required in the
Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.

• Accelerated scale up of the clean energy transition means there is very little runway
left for growth in fossil fuels: for the first time, demand for oil, natural gas and coal
each peak in the three World Energy Outlook-2023 scenarios before 2030. The share
of fossil fuels in primary energy demand declines from 80% over the last two decades
to 73% in the STEPS by 2030, 69% in the APS and 62% in the NZE Scenario.

• Electricity supply becomes progressively cleaner as low-emissions sources increase
faster than demand in each scenario. Solar PV is the clear frontrunner, but wind also
scales up despite near-term supply chain challenges, while nuclear power, other
renewables and low-emissions fuels all make progress too.

• Electrification of mobility and heat accelerates in each scenario, although not at the
same rate as power sector decarbonisation. Energy efficiency plays a key role in all
sectors in determining total final consumption. In the STEPS, consumption increases
by an annual average of 0.7% through to 2050; in the APS, it peaks in the late 2020s
and then slowly starts to decline; in the NZE Scenario, it falls 1% per year from today.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) are making muchneeded progress. The pipeline of projects shows that more than 400 GW of
electrolysis for hydrogen and over 400 million tonnes of CO2 capture capacity are
vying to be operational by 2030. This could potentially meet the milestones of the APS
if all planned projects go ahead, but cost inflation and supply chain bottlenecks could
hamper progress.

Introduction

Amid the wild fluctuations in prices and other indicators caused by the global energy crisis,
one data point stands out for being unremarkable: global energy demand rose by 1.3% in
2022. That energy demand continued to grow by a more or less average amount amid all the
market turbulence hints at the inexorable underlying dynamics of the energy system: the
expanding global economy and population simply require more energy services.
This should be the starting point for any conversation about the future of global energy, and
indeed this is where our modelling process begins in this World Energy Outlook (WEO). The
first step in producing our scenario projections is not to look at emissions, investment or
resources, but to look in detail at demand for energy services: how much light, heat or
mobility communities, industries and countries around the world will need over the decades
to 2050.
Levels of energy services demand evolve at roughly the same rate across each of our
scenarios as the global economy grows, with two important nuances. First is that the speed
at which the world moves towards universal access to modern energy varies; achievement
of this goal invariably leads to higher use of energy services for lighting, cooling, cooking, and
appliance and equipment use. Second is that behavioural changes and strategies to improve
material efficiency, adopted to varying degrees in each scenario, bring down demand for
energy services, for example by substituting short car journeys for walking or cycling.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Rising energy services demand is a feature of each scenario, but that does not necessarily
translate into rising demand for energy or a higher level of emissions. A wide range of
technology mixes can meet needs for heating, cooling or mobility, each with distinctive
implications for costs, resource inputs and pollution. We explore different pathways in this
chapter, examining how investment in a range of technologies and resources could meet the
world’s future energy needs, and how policies shape the choices that are made. This chapter
starts with an overview of the key changes in the global energy mix across each scenario.
This is followed by four sections:


First is a look at trends in global energy final consumption in the industry, transport and
buildings sectors and how demand is met in each scenario.



Second is a detailed consideration of the outlook for electricity, including scenario
specific mix of generation technologies and at variations in demand stemming from the
efficiency of end-use equipment and appliances.



Third is a look at fuels: oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy. Fossil fuels account for close
to 80% of total energy supply today. But the outlook to 2050 varies widely in the
scenarios according to the speed at which clean energy technologies enter the system.



The fourth section considers the evolution of key clean energy technologies, focussing
on solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind, electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, hydrogen and
carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).

Overview

Global total energy demand increases from around 630 exajoules (EJ) in 2022 to 670 EJ by
2030 in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). This corresponds to an average annual growth
rate of 0.7%, around half the rate of energy demand growth over the last decade. Demand
continues to increase from 2030 through to 2050, with a growth of 16% in emerging market
and developing economies more than offsetting a 9% decline in advanced economies. In the
Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), total energy demand declines by an average of 0.1% per
year until 2030, thanks to faster deployment of renewables, increased energy efficiency and
more rapid electrification than in the STEPS. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)
Scenario, electrification proceeds even faster, improving the efficiency of the energy system
and leading to a decline in primary energy of 1.2% per year to 2030.

Note: Mtce = million tonnes of coal equivalent; mb/d = million barrels per day; tcm = trillion cubic metres;
EJ = exajoules.

In each of the scenarios in this World Energy Outlook, demand for each of the main fossil
fuels – coal, oil and natural gas – reaches a peak before 2030 before falling back (Figure 3.1).
Coal demand declines furthest and fastest: by 2030, it falls by around 15% in the STEPS, 25%
in the APS, and 45% in the NZE Scenario. In the APS, China and India's pledges to reach net
zero emissions before 2060 and by 2070 respectively drive a faster decline in coal demand
than in the STEPS. In the NZE Scenario, a broader phase out of unabated coal across regions
begins during the 2020s, and this leads to demand falling faster than in the APS. Oil peaks
towards the end of this decade in the STEPS at around 102 million barrels per day (mb/d). In
the APS and the NZE Scenario, rapid and broad-based electrification and fast-growing use of
104

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

advanced biofuels together hasten the peak in oil demand. Natural gas demand increases
until the late 2020s in the STEPS, reaching a high point of around 4 300 billion cubic
metres (bcm). In the APS, natural gas demand declines by 7% between 2022 and 2030 as lowemissions power expands rapidly, electrification increases faster than in the STEPS and gains
are made in terms of energy and material efficiency in the buildings and industry sectors. In
the NZE Scenario, gas demand declines by nearly 20% by 2030 in the face of very large clean
energy investments and efficiency gains.
For decades, fossil fuels have met around 80% of total energy demand. Rapid growth in
renewables and nuclear begins to erode this dominance in the coming years, lowering the
share of unabated fossil fuel demand in 2030 to 73% in the STEPS, 69% in the APS, and 62%
in the NZE Scenario. Avoided energy demand helps to enable this shift: without faster
efficiency improvements and behavioural changes, more clean energy supply would go
toward meeting rising demand, rather than substituting for fossil fuels.
All sources of renewable energy increase over time in each of the scenarios, although their
relative weights shift. Today modern bioenergy 1 accounts for over half of renewables energy
demand, but solar PV and wind expand extremely fast in the coming years, especially in the
power sector. The installed capacity of all renewable power sources more than doubles in
the STEPS and the APS by 2030. In the NZE Scenario, the installed capacity of renewables
triples by 2030 – a key milestone in the drive to keep the 1.5 °C goal within reach.

Today, low‐emissions sources of electricity generation mainly include nuclear (9% of
electricity generation) and renewables (30%). The share of nuclear power remains broadly
stable over time in all scenarios. Low-emissions electricity generation overall increases from
39% of total electricity generation today to 57% by 2030 in the STEPS, 63% in the APS and
71% in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.2). This constitutes exceptionally rapid growth by historic
standards, which reflects the cost effectiveness of solar PV and wind, and their ability to
attract investment in manufacturing capacity as well as in deployment.
The share of electricity in final consumption also rises from its current level of 20%, which
means that low-emissions sources of electricity generation are increasing their share of a
total which is itself increasing. In the STEPS, the electricity share of final consumption rises
to 2030 at a rate similar to the past, before accelerating slightly and reaching 30% by 2050.
In the APS, it rises faster, in large part due to the more rapid uptake of EVs, reaching 40% by
2050. In the NZE Scenario, it nears 30% in 2030 and exceeds 50% by 2050, propelled in
particular by the extremely rapid deployment not only of EVs but also of residential and
industrial heat pumps.

Energy intensity 2 improves at an average rate of 2.2% per year to 2030 in the STEPS,
compared with 3% in the APS and 4.1% in the NZE Scenario. All scenarios improve on the
annual average rate of 1.6% over the last decade, thanks to more stringent fuel economy
standards, additional building energy codes and retrofit targets, improved industrial energy
management systems, and the further electrification of heat and mobility. Advanced
economies have lower levels of energy intensity today than emerging market and
development economies, but that is in large part a function of them typically having more
service-oriented economies.
Global energy demand per capita is around 80 gigajoules (GJ) today, a level that has
remained broadly stable over the last decade (Figure 3.3). It remains stable in the STEPS to
2030, but it declines by 7% in the APS and by 15% in the NZE Scenario. In advanced
economies, per capita demand declines in all scenarios to 2030. In emerging market and
developing economies, it continues to rise in the STEPS as economic growth drives an
increase in energy services demand. In each scenario, energy demand per capita in this group
of countries remains below advanced economies over the projection period.

3.3

Total final energy consumption

Total final energy consumption (TFC) is 442 EJ today and is split between industry (167 EJ),
buildings (133 EJ), transport (116 EJ) and other end-uses (27 EJ). In the STEPS, TFC rises by
1.1% per year to 2030 and then continues to rise at a slower rate through to 2050. In the
APS, TFC rises until the mid-2020s before starting a gradual decline. In the NZE Scenario, TFC
declines by an annual average 0.9% every year from now to 2050.
Differences in energy efficiency gains are the primary cause of divergence in total final
consumption trajectories. They account for nearly half of the total energy savings in the APS
relative to the STEPS by 2030, with the APS reflecting additional retrofit targets and updated
building energy codes, more stringent fuel economy standards in transport, and upgrades to
industrial processes efficiency. In the NZE Scenario, year-on-year energy intensity
improvements double by 2030 (IEA, 2023a).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Differences in the rate of electrification are another important cause of divergence in
consumption trajectories. In the APS, electrification provides another 10% of the energy
savings relative to the STEPS by 2030. Electric technologies such as heat pumps and EVs
provide energy services more efficiently than rival technologies based on the direct
combustion of fossil fuels, and use of these electric technologies expands faster in the APS
and the NZE Scenario than in the STEPS. The share of electricity in TFC increases from around
20% today by 2 percentage points in the STEPS by 2030, by 4 percentage points in the APS,
and by 8 percentage points in the NZE Scenario: it is these differences that deliver the

additional energy savings in the APS and the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.4). Rail and road
transport, iron and steel, aluminium, light industries as well as heating and cooking in
buildings see the most substantial increases in electricity share across scenarios.

Note: Modern renewables refers to the direct use of renewable energy sources excluding the traditional use

The direct use of renewables in total final energy consumption – including modern
bioenergy, solar thermal and geothermal – expands significantly in each scenario, by 3% per
year in the STEPS, 7% in the APS, and 9% in the NZE Scenario by 2030. Low-emissions
hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels final consumption increases by 200 petajoules (PJ) (of
which 1.6 million tonnes [Mt] of hydrogen) in the STEPS by 2030 and 1 000 PJ (of which 6 Mt
of hydrogen) in the APS, with growth concentrated in hard-to-abate sectors including
aviation and shipping. Renewables and low-emissions fuels contribute 8% of the additional
energy savings in the APS compared to the STEPS by 2030.

Industry

Industry is the most energy consuming and CO2 emitting end-use sector. It accounts for 38%
of TFC and 47% of CO2 emissions (including emissions from electricity and heat). Energyintensive industries – iron and steel, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, non-ferrous metals
and paper sectors – account for almost 90% of demand for coal used in industry, more than
70% for oil used in industry and almost 55% for natural gas (Figure 3.5). Energy-intensive
industries have in common high-temperature needs and long-lived assets. Other industry, or
108

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

non-energy-intensive industries, which includes light industries such as food and textiles,
have lower temperature needs and account for the remaining 30% of demand in the industry
sector. Its energy mix is mainly electricity (37%), natural gas (20%), oil (15%) and bioenergy
(14%).

Industrial production underwent significant disruption in 2022 as a result of Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine and a slowdown in the construction sector in China. Global cement production
was down by 5% and steel production by 4%, though demand for chemicals remained stable,
and in the case of methanol it actually rose. These downward pressures on industrial
production do not persist: in the STEPS, production of all main industrial materials increases
by 2030, including ethylene (27% higher), methanol (17% higher), aluminium (13% higher)
and paper (12% higher), and steel and ammonia (each 10% higher) and cement (8% higher).
The rise in production mainly occurs in developing Asia.
Progress in developing efficiency and low-emissions policies for industry has been uneven,
with patchy adoption of carbon pricing and minimum energy performance standards (MEPS)
in emerging market and developing economies (Table 3.1). Some groups of industrial
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

109

stakeholders have taken the initiative and set targets to produce low-emissions materials.
For example, steel purchasers in the First Mover Coalition have pledged that at “at least 10%
(by volume) of all our steel purchased per year will be near-zero emissions […] by 2030”.

In the APS, measures promoting material efficiency, such as lifetime extension of buildings
and goods, lightweighting or smart design, help curb global demand for industrial material
demand compared with the STEPS. The impact of these measures builds over time. For
example, global crude steel demand is 5% lower in the APS than in the STEPS in 2035 and
13% lower by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, more widespread deployment of such measures
leads steel, cement and methanol to peak within the next fifteen years.
Coal demand in the industry sector peaks in the mid-2020s in the STEPS, falls below the 2022
level in 2035 and is 10% below this level by 2050, with reductions in demand in China and
advanced economies more than offsetting increases in the rest of developing Asia, Africa and
Latin America and the Caribbean. The main reason for the overall decline is the rise of
secondary steel production, mostly relying on electricity, in lieu of conventional primary steel
production using coking coal. In all scenarios, scrap availability limits the deployment of
secondary production. In both the STEPS and APS, the share of secondary production doubles
compared to today to more than 40% worldwide. In the APS, electrification of light
industries, hydrogen-based iron production and higher reliance on bioenergy mean that coal
110

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

use in industry in 2050 is 55% lower than in the STEPS, and almost 20% of coal use takes
place in plants equipped with CCUS.
Oil use in industry, mostly for petrochemical production, increases by 2.8 mb/d to 2030 in
the STEPS, with most of the growth taking place in China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.
In the APS, bans on single-use plastics and the widespread collection of plastics help to curb
the increase in oil demand to 0.8 mb/d from 2022 to 2030, and to bring it down by 3.6 mb/d
by 2050 compared to 2030. The share of non-energy use, i.e. chemical feedstock and anode
production, in industry oil demand rises from 60% today to over 65% in 2030 and 80% in
2050.
Natural gas in industry is used in a wide range of applications: a third is consumed in other
industry, especially in food and machinery, and more than a fifth goes towards the
production of fertiliser. In the STEPS, developing Asia, led by China remains the largest source
of growth for natural gas demand in industry until 2030, although its rate of growth is much
slower than over the past decade. India becomes the largest source of growth after 2030,
while demand in the European Union declines further.
In all scenarios, electricity is the fuel that increases the most in non-energy-intensive
industries, and sustainable bioenergy takes second place. Increased electrification plays a
significant part in decarbonising energy-intensive industries, whether through direct
electrification or through the use of hydrogen produced using electrolysers.

How can industrial processes achieve high levels of electrification?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

As of today, most electricity in industry is used for motor-driven systems. Electricity has the
potential to provide heating across a wide range of temperature levels for heating, including
through heat pumps for low-temperature applications and electric arc furnaces for high
temperature (as it already does for secondary steel making). It also has the potential to
provide power for a range of industrial processes including alumina electrolysis, which
produces aluminium and electrowinning, which produces copper and nickel. Electrification
reduces energy demand because it is generally more efficient that the fossil fuel processes
that it replaces. To the extent that it draws on low-emissions sources of power, electrification
also drives down CO2 emissions from the industry sector.
Around 65% of electricity use today in industry is for motor-driven systems. Motors are used
to drive pumps, fans, compressed air systems, material handling, processing systems and
more. Over the last decade, motor-driven systems accounted for almost 60% (630 terawatthours [TWh]) of growth in electricity demand in light industries, and they are set to be the
largest source of electricity demand in the industry sector in the years ahead. There is some
potential to improve energy efficiency not only by upgrading the motors themselves but also
by making other improvements to the system, for example by downsizing electric capacity
to match the service required. Sixty-two countries have implemented MEPS for industrial
electric motors, covering more than half of the global industrial motor fleet in 2022: more
widespread adoption of MEPS would bring further energy efficiency gains.

Electrification of process heat increases in all scenarios, though at various speeds
(Figure 3.6). In the light industry category, over 700 TWh or one-fifth of electricity is currently
used for heating purposes, and this rises to over 800 TWh in 2030 and 1 000 TWh in 2050 in
the STEPS. In the APS, the electrification of process heat happens much faster: the 1 000 TWh
mark is passed by 2030, and demand reaches 1 800 TWh by 2050. The APS also sees
innovative progress towards the direct electrification of energy-intensive processes such as
alumina refining, secondary aluminium production, kilns and steam crackers.

All industry sub-sectors depend on electricity and demand rises
notably for process heat and hydrogen in the APS and NZE Scenario

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The use of electricity in steel, ammonia and methanol production is likely to depend on the
onsite production and use of electrolytic hydrogen. There is scope, for example, for hydrogen
to be used in ancillary processes in various heavy industries, including semi-finishing for steel
and aluminium. These important near-zero-carbon options are mostly deployed in the APS
and the NZE Scenario. In 2050, global onsite electrolytic hydrogen demand in industry
reaches 36 Mt in the APS, consuming 1 600 TWh of electricity: the hydrogen is used to
produce around a quarter of iron, ammonia and methanol.
Electricity is also used in other electro-chemical processes mostly for primary aluminium
production. Electricity use for primary aluminium production increases in the APS until 2040,
rising to 700 TWh, then declines as expanding scrap availability leads to rising levels of
secondary production.

Transport

Energy demand in transport rose by 4% in 2022 as it continued to rebound towards pre-Covid
levels, with oil accounting for 90% of this growth. This was mainly driven by the aviation
sector, which saw 20% year-on-year growth: despite this, aviation energy demand remains a
quarter below its 2019 level. Electricity demand from road transport was nearly 60% higher
in 2022 than in 2019, and the market share of electric cars 3 in new registrations reached 14%.
In the STEPS, the global car fleet increases by over 15% by 2030, and a similar increase is
projected for buses. The fleet of two/three-wheelers 4 increases by over 20% and the number
of trucks by over 10% over the same period. Aviation activity doubles from today’s level, rail
passenger-kilometres increase by 36%, and shipping tonne-kilometres increase by almost
20% in 2030. In the APS, modal shifts away from private transportation lessen the growth of
the car fleet and lead to rail passenger-kilometres being over 5% higher in 2030 than in the
STEPS. In the NZE Scenario, stronger measures to minimise emissions reduce the activity in
aviation by 20% and the car stock by 15% compared to the STEPS in 2050: these measures
include behaviour changes and the expansion of high-speed rail.

By 2030, the share of oil in road transport energy demand drops from 92% today to 88% in
the STEPS, 84% in the APS, and 78% in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.7). A tectonic shift towards
electromobility and the increased use of biofuels drive this drop. Electricity demand for road
transport rises by more than 12-times by 2030 in the STEPS and over 15-times in the APS.
Supported by phase-out dates for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and incentives
for electromobility, EVs account for nearly 20% of total road vehicle-kilometres in the APS in
2030. However, since they are three- to four-times more efficient than ICE vehicles, they only
account for 5% of road transport energy demand.

Electrification of trucks so far has made slower progress than the electrification of cars, in
part because it has attracted less policy support (Table 3.2). Battery electric trucks have
nevertheless seen notable advancements, particularly as medium-duty trucks and other
vehicles with relatively short, fixed routes. In the STEPS, the market share of electric trucks
rises from 3% of global truck sales today to nearly 20% by 2030 in the STEPS and to 25% in
the APS.
The electrification of two/three-wheelers proceeds much more rapidly, in part because of
their limited power needs and the relatively modest upfront cost increase compared to
114

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

conventional powertrains. The electric two/three-wheelers fleet in 2030 is more than fourtimes larger than today.
In non-road transport energy demand, the share of oil remains nearly at today’s level (85%)
in both the STEPS and APS by 2030; it drops to around 75% in the NZE Scenario. Rail is the
most electrified transport mode today, and the share of oil in energy demand in rail falls from
53% today to 46% and 40% in the STEPS and APS due to increased rail electrification. In the
NZE Scenario, the speed and breadth of further electrification reduces the share of oil in total
rail demand to around 30% by 2030. Oil continues to account for most of the energy demand
in aviation to 2030 in both the STEPS and APS. The same is broadly true for shipping, although
the share of oil in energy demand in shipping starts to decline slightly by 2030 as natural gas
and bioenergy begin to make inroads into its energy mix. In the STEPS, together they account
for 4% of energy demand in shipping by 2030. In the APS, they account for 6% of demand,
while ammonia, hydrogen, electricity and synthetic methanol reduce the share of oil by
another 4 percentage points. In the NZE Scenario, the share of oil in energy demand in
shipping falls to 80% by 2030. The European Union decision to include maritime emissions in
the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the International Maritime Organization
revision of its greenhouse gas strategy both boost efforts to decarbonise shipping. The
FuelEU Maritime initiative and the US Clean Shipping Act support efforts to do the same by
incentivising the use of cleaner fuels.

Are we heading towards the end of the ICE age?
Oil use for road transport is responsible for nearly 45% of global oil demand. It currently
totals around 41 mb/d, with cars accounting for 21 mb/d and trucks for 16 mb/d.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

ICE car sales grew by an annual average of 3.4% from 2010 to 2017, peaking at 85 million
vehicle registrations in 2017. The Covid-19 pandemic caused sales to dip by 13% in 2020.
Since then, sales of ICE cars have recovered only marginally while sales of electric cars shot
up from 3 million in 2020 to over 10 million in 2022. In the years ahead, total car sales are
set to increase by over 30% to reach nearly 100 million by 2030. Around two-thirds of this
comes from emerging market and developing economies, in particular China, India and
Indonesia. But the rise of EVs means that sales of ICE cars does not revert to the 2017 peak
level (Figure 3.8). In the STEPS and APS, widespread policy support helps sales of electric cars
worldwide to continue their impressive expansion. More than 50 countries, home to around
60% of the world population, have policies in place to incentivise the uptake of EVs. Around
30 countries have set target dates to phase out ICE vehicles, and several others are
considering similar action. In addition, automobile manufacturers have plans to release over
150 new electric car models in the coming years, and some have made their own net zero
emissions commitments. Efforts are being made to establish local EV manufacturing hubs in
a number of countries including India, Indonesia and Thailand, providing a further boost for
their switch from ICE vehicles to EVs.
These measures mean that sales of electric cars continue their impressive growth. By 2030,
sales of ICE cars decline to around 60 million in the STEPS and 55 million in the APS. With this
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

115

structural decline of ICE vehicles in road vehicles, oil demand does not recover to its prepandemic levels: it stands at around 41 mb/d by 2030 in the STEPS and around 38 mb/d in
the APS. Electric cars currently displace 0.4 mb/d of oil demand, and this rises to nearly
4 mb/d by the end of this decade, bringing energy security benefits to oil importing countries
and reducing the number of consumers exposed to volatile oil prices.

In China, sales of electric cars accounted for 29% of the market in 2022; they are set to reach
over 35% in 2023 and 65% by 2030 in the STEPS with the support of tax exemptions. Sales of
electric cars in the European Union made up over 20% of the market in 2022, and the latest
CO2 standards adopted for passenger cars look set to help increase that market share to over
60% by 2030. In the United States, electric car sales saw a more than 55% year-on-year
increase in 2022 and now represent around 8% of the market. The sales share increases to
50% by 2030 as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law help to boost
affordability and support the roll-out of charging infrastructure.
Strong policy support, particularly in China, helped EVs to become increasingly competitive
in the market and to become central to the challenge to reduce emissions. Action is now
needed to ensure rapid deployment of EV charging facilities and to enhance electricity
networks so that inadequate infrastructure does not hold back their expansion. Action is also
needed to continue the rapid deployment of renewables in electricity generation: the
emissions benefits of the shift to EVs depend upon the availability of low-emissions
electricity.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

How can emissions from aviation be reduced?
Aviation accounts for over 2% of energy-related emissions and is currently dominated by oil.
A variety of parallel strategies are needed to decarbonise aviation. Improvements in
aerodynamics and lightweighting materials have led modern airplanes to be nearly 20% more
efficient than those built around a decade ago. There will be further improvements to come,
but technology, material and design changes in aeronautics are characterised by long
implementation times. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) offer scope to replace oil and reduce
emissions, but they are still very expensive and today represent less than 0.01% of energy
demand in aviation. In the NZE Scenario, behaviour changes are another key lever, without
them, total aviation activity would be 10% higher by 2030 and over 20% higher by 2050.

Accelerating the use of sustainable aviation fuels and reducing in-flight energy
demand through efficiency measures are key to curbing oil demand growth
Note: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) set an aspirational goal in 2010 to improve fuel
intensity (measured per revenue tonne-kilometre) by 2% per year to 2050.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Each year, the fuel intensity of the global aircraft fleet improves by around 1% due to stock
turnover as older models are retired. In the STEPS, the widespread use of cost-effective
operational efficiency measures such as single engine taxiing and optimised flight trajectories
increases this efficiency rate to 1.3% each year through to 2050. The APS sees this rise to
over 1.4% as a result of further improvements including electric taxiing and formation flying.
The NZE Scenario reaches the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) goal of a 2%
annual reduction each year until 2050: this assumes vital additional support for research and
development for revolutionary airframes and hybrid electric aircrafts (Figure 3.9).
Efficiency improvements have a very important part to play, but they offer only a partial
answer to the problem of aviation emissions. They cannot even entirely counterbalance
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

117

growth in demand for aviation, which is expected to lead to an increase of around 4% in flight
activity each year until 2050. This points to an urgent need for the development and
deployment of lower carbon fuels. SAF look to be the most promising option: whether in the
form of biojet kerosene or synthetic kerosene, they are drop-in fuels that can be blended
with conventional oil products at rates of up to 50%. They also have the potential to be used
on their own: manufacturers and airlines are currently testing flights that run solely on SAF.
Although SAF off-take agreements more than doubled in volume between 2021 and 2022,
signalling growing demand, high costs remain a barrier to widespread adoption, and the
announced project pipeline covers only 1-2% of global aviation demand by 2027 (IEA, 2022a).
Bio-kerosene production currently costs twice as much as conventional kerosene, and
synthetic kerosene four-times more. Expanding supply will help reduce costs, but the
average price of SAF is still expected to be around two times higher than that of conventional
kerosene in 2030.
In the STEPS, biojet kerosene makes up 2% of total energy demand in aviation in 2030 and
6% in 2050, compared with over 5% and 37% respectively in the APS, and 11% and 70%
respectively in the NZE Scenario. Synthetic kerosene demand in 2050 in the NZE Scenario is
nearly double the levels in the APS. The higher levels of demand in the APS and the
NZE Scenario assume higher levels of support for SAF from governments and increased
industry investments in the context of broader policy frameworks that give a high priority to
reducing emissions.
There are some grounds for optimism on this score, since there are already a number of
policies focussed on SAF, though the detail has still to be worked through in many cases. The
US Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for SAF, and this support could enable
production to reach 3 billion gallons (0.2 mb/d) in 2030 and 35 billion gallons (2.3 mb/d) by
2050, which would be enough to fuel all US flights by 2050. SAF are also supported by EU
Innovation Fund grants, Japan’s planned mandate for SAF to provide 10% of aviation fuel use
by 2030, the UK Jet Zero pledge to decarbonise aviation by 2050, and ReFuelEU Aviation’s
mandate for the share of SAF in aviation fuel to reach 70% by 2050.
However, there is a limited supply of the resources used today to produce sustainable
biofuels, including cooking oil and waste animal fats, and a feedstock crunch could hamper
growth in the short term. To meet additional biofuel demand over time, alternative
production pathways using materials such as municipal solid waste and agricultural and
forestry residues need to be commercialised. Government support and private investments
are also needed for the development and commercialisation of SAF technologies that have
low technology readiness and high costs today, notably synthetic kerosene.

Buildings

Total energy consumption in the buildings sector increased on average by 1% per year over
the last decade and reached 133 EJ in 2022 (Figure 3.10). Natural gas demand declined in
2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a mild winter, with the decline most noted
in Europe, but natural gas still met 23% of energy demand in buildings worldwide. Electricity
118

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

now accounts for over one-third of energy demand in the buildings sector: its share has
steadily increased with expanding ownership of appliances and air conditioners, and
electrification of heating and cooking. Modern bioenergy meets 4% of energy demand in
buildings, and other direct uses of renewables, in the form of solar thermal and geothermal
heating, more than doubled over the last decade to now account for 2% of demand.

In the STEPS, global buildings energy demand increases to almost 140 EJ in 2030 and 160 EJ
in 2050, primarily because the number of households increases from around 2.2 billion today
to 3 billion by 2050, with the largest increases in Africa and the Asia Pacific. Global floor area
of residential buildings expands from around 200 billion square metres today to 310 billion
in 2050. In the APS, energy demand declines over time despite these upward pressures on
energy demand, thanks to improved efficiency in building envelopes and technologies. By
2030, energy demand in buildings is 12% lower in the APS than in the STEPS.
The share of electricity in buildings sector energy demand increases substantially in each
scenario, rising from 35% today to 40% in the STEPS, 43% in the APS, and 48% in the

NZE Scenario by 2030. In the STEPS, power sector decarbonisation and the use of electricity
and renewables in place of coal and oil leads to a decline in buildings sector emissions
(including indirect emissions 5) of 1.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) by 2030 despite
rising energy demand, notably for space cooling. The APS reflects additional pledges to
provide access to clean cooking (see Chapter 4, section 4.4.1), with modern bioenergy
meeting most of this additional consumption. Buildings sector emissions decline more than
twice as fast as in the STEPS by 2030.

Implementation of proposals to improve building envelopes lowers heating

Notes: m2 = square metre; kWh/ m2 = kilowatt-hour per square metre. Zero-carbon-ready envelopes enable a
building to be zero-carbon emissions without further renovation once the power and natural gas grids that it
relies on are fully decarbonised. Heated and cooled floorspace evolves over time with changes in climate and
in the ownership of heating and cooling technologies.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

A key difference between the scenarios is the level of ambition for improving building designs
(Figure 3.11). In the STEPS, around 45% of the building stock is constructed or retrofitted in
compliance with building energy codes or zero-carbon-ready standards by 2050. In the APS,
this share exceeds 65%, accounting for increased policy ambition including the proposed
update to the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, proposed new standards for
federal buildings in the United States, and China’s Carbon Peaking and Neutrality Blueprint
for Urbanisation and Rural Development. While the energy savings gained from compliance
with building energy codes vary depending on the stringency of the codes, zero-carbon-ready
standards more than halve heating and cooling demand compared with the average stock
today. Policy incentives counterbalance barriers to improving building envelopes, including
5 Indirect emissions are from the electricity and heat generation needed to meet demand in buildings.

the cost of materials and the split incentives faced by property owners and tenants (IEA,
2023a). Compared to buildings constructed over the last decade, those constructed in the
2030s are on average 15% more efficient in the STEPS and 36% more efficient in the APS. In
the NZE Scenario, they are 66% more efficient, with all new buildings from 2030 onwards
being zero-carbon-ready and a larger share of existing buildings undergoing retrofits.

Notes: In regions with one country, unless there is a national policy in place, shares are shown for subnational
jurisdictions. Some policy types are not equally relevant for all regions given variations in heating and cooling
needs and the age of the building stock.

Deploying more energy-efficient technologies is another key factor differentiating energy
demand and emissions in the buildings sector in our scenarios. Installed capacity of heat
pumps in buildings is around 15% higher in the APS than in the STEPS by 2030, while unit
electricity consumption of appliances decreases by over 10% over the same period compared
with around 5% in the STEPS, partly because of more effective MEPS. They are a primary
policy tool for improving technology efficiency and are implemented relatively consistently
across regions compared to other types of policies related to the buildings sector (Table 3.3).
Nevertheless, there is scope for them to be more widely adopted, and for more stringent
standards and enforcement. Second-hand markets for appliances pose a particular barrier to
further efficiency gains, especially with rapid growth in the ownership of appliances and air
conditioners in developing economies. In the NZE Scenario, light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
make up 100% of lighting sales by 2030 and best available technologies make up the majority
of appliance and cooling equipment sales by 2035.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

121

What will it take to decarbonise heating in buildings?
Heating – space and water heating – accounts for around 45% of energy demand and 80% of
direct CO2 emissions from buildings. In the STEPS, the share of energy service demand for
heating met by fossil fuels is 50% by 2030 and 35% by 2050, and heating still releases
emissions of 1.5 Gt CO2 each year by 2050 (Figure 3.12). In the NZE Scenario, by contrast,
heating is entirely decarbonised through a switch to electricity, renewables and district heat
and through efficiency gains via envelope and technology improvements. Electrification in
the NZE Scenario relies strongly on the uptake of heat pumps, which have seen rapid
expansion in recent years (section 3.6).

Fuel switching is critical to decarbonise heating, including through the phase-out of
fossil fuel boilers and the uptake of heat pumps and other low-emissions options

Policies that support the decarbonisation of heating include building energy codes, heating
intensity standards, carbon pricing, incentives to adopt heat pumps and clean technologies
and bans on the sale of new fossil fuel equipment. To date, 13 European countries have
implemented or announced national bans or other national policies to limit the installation
of oil-fired boilers, of which nine have done the same for gas-fired boilers. Sub-national
jurisdictions within Australia, Canada, China and United States, among other countries, have
announced similar measures. In the APS, the implementation of bans on fossil fuel boilers or
furnaces that have been announced to date reduces heating direct emissions by 420 million
tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) by 2050. While bans on fossil fuel boilers are only one
example of many policy solutions that can decarbonise energy use for heating in buildings,
they can be useful to provide clear market signals to stakeholders and to align incentives for
property owners and renters. In the NZE Scenario, bans on fossil fuel boilers are applied in
every region from 2025 onwards, resulting in cumulative emissions savings of 19 Gt CO2 from
today to 2050.
122

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Although high upfront costs present a deterrent to many households, switching to non-fossil
fuel options can reduce household spending on heating over time (IEA, 2022b). While fossil
fuel boilers and furnaces have lower upfront costs in most markets, heat pumps typically
have lower operating costs due to their high efficiency. IEA analysis of life cycle costs by
heating technology (based on average non-subsidised technology prices and relying on enduser fuel price projections consistent with the STEPS) finds oil-fired boilers to often be the
most expensive option. Heat pump and gas-fired boiler life cycle costs are more comparable,
with cost differences depending chiefly on fuel and CO2 prices and on gas and electricity
network costs. In densely populated areas, where the installation of heat pumps can prove
difficult in some buildings, district heating can provide a viable low-emissions alternative.

Electricity

Overview
Global electricity demand is set to increase rapidly in all scenarios as a result of population
and income growth and the electrification of increasing numbers of end-uses. By 2050,
demand for electricity rises from its current level by over 80% in the STEPS, 120% in the APS
and 150% in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.13). The additional demand is met mainly by lowemissions sources of electricity – renewables, nuclear power, fossil fuels equipped with
carbon capture, hydrogen and ammonia – raising their share of electricity supply in each
scenario. The share of unabated fossil fuels declines sharply, with their combined output
falling by over one-third from 2022 to 2050 in the STEPS, three-quarters in the APS and nearly
100% in the NZE Scenario.

Electricity demand
Global electricity demand growth to 2050 is driven by emerging market and developing
economies, which together account for about three-quarters of the global total in the STEPS,
APS and NZE Scenario. Today, China is the largest electricity consumer and demand growth
of over 2% on average per year to 2050 in all scenarios means that it uses twice or more as
much electricity as any other country by 2050. Annual electricity demand growth of around
5% puts India behind only China and the United States in terms of electricity consumption by
2050 in all scenarios. Other emerging market and developing economies also see robust
electricity demand growth stemming from increasing populations, economic development
and rising incomes. In advanced economies as a group, electricity demand growth is lower,
ranging between 1.4% per year in the STEPS to 2.4% in the NZE Scenario.
Global electricity demand rises in all sectors and in all scenarios. The buildings sector remains
the largest in terms of consumption through to 2050 in the STEPS and APS as demand
continues to rise for appliances, space cooling and heating and water heating, though
enhanced energy efficiency tempers growth in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.14). The industry
sector continues to be the second-largest user of electricity in the STEPS and APS, with
electric motors accounting for much of its demand, but becomes the largest in the
NZE Scenario. EVs account for about 15% of total electricity demand growth to 2050 in the
STEPS, and a higher percentage in the APS and NZE Scenario, where EV sales rise faster and
become a key driver of electricity demand growth. The production of hydrogen via
electrolysis remains limited in the STEPS but adds significantly to electricity demand growth
in the APS and even more so in the NZE Scenario.

Electricity supply
Responses to the current energy crisis have emphasised addressing security challenges while
accelerating clean energy transitions, particularly in the electricity sector. Recent policy
developments have boosted the prospects for renewables in major markets, including China,
European Union, India, Japan and United States (Table 3.4). Prospects for nuclear power
have also improved in leading markets, with support for lifetime extension of existing nuclear
reactors in a number of countries including Japan, Korea and United States, and support for
new reactors in Canada, China, United Kingdom, United States, and several EU member
states (IEA, 2023b). Recent policy developments have been mixed for natural gas use in the
power sector: European Union, Korea and Japan are taking efforts to reduce demand and
reliance on imports, while China sees a continued role for natural gas. While the current
global energy crisis has led to a temporary uptick in coal-fired power generation, countries
with plans to phase out unabated coal remain committed.

The growth of electricity generation from low-emissions sources accelerates in all three
scenarios, with their combined output quadrupling from 2022 to 2050 in the STEPS, growing
to 5.5-times its current level in the APS, and increasing sevenfold in the NZE Scenario
(Figure 3.15). As a result, the global share of electricity generation from low-emissions
sources from 39% in 2022 rises by 2050 to about 80% in the STEPS, over 90% in the APS, and
nearly 100% in the NZE Scenario. This enables advanced economies and emerging market
and developing economies alike to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.

Renewables outpace electricity demand growth to 2030 in the STEPS, leading to a peak in
coal-fired power in the near term though announced pledges call for faster declines
Notes: TWh = terawatt-hours. Other low-emissions include fossil fuels with CCUS, hydrogen and ammonia.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Renewables provided 30% of electricity generated worldwide in 2022, and this rises to nearly
50% by 2030 in the STEPS. Hydropower is the largest low-emissions source of electricity
today, accounting for 15% of generation, but its annual output can vary widely, and high
upfront capital costs and limitations on development of favourable sites constrain further
growth prospects. Other renewables – bioenergy, geothermal, concentrating solar and
marine power – have a part to play too, but solar PV and wind are the central technologies
in the roll-out of renewables to decarbonise energy supply faster. Renewables capacity
expands 2.4-fold in the STEPS by 2030, 2.7-fold in the APS and triples in the NZE Scenario,
and almost 95% of this growth is in the form of solar PV and wind (Figure 3.16). The share of
wind and solar PV in total generation is set to rise from 12% to about 30% by 2030, putting
power system flexibility at the heart of electricity security (see Chapter 4) and underlining
the need to speed up permitting and grid expansion (IEA, 2023a).
Nuclear power is the second-largest source of low-emissions power worldwide today, behind
hydropower but far larger than wind or solar PV. In advanced economies, nuclear power is
the largest source of low-emissions electricity. After a decade of slow deployment in the
wake of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan, a changing
policy landscape is creating opportunities for a nuclear comeback (IEA, 2022c). Nuclear
power capacity increases from 417 GW in 2022 to 620 GW in 2050 in the STEPS, with growth
mainly in China and other emerging market and developing economies, while advanced
economies carry out widespread lifetime extensions and look to build new projects to offset
retirements. Large-scale reactors remain the dominant form of nuclear power in all
scenarios, including advanced reactor designs, but the development of and growing interest
in small modular reactors increases the potential for nuclear power in the long run (NEA,
126

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

2022). More lifetime extensions and new construction in countries open to nuclear power
boost global capacity in the APS to 770 GW in 2050, and to well over 900 GW in the NZE
Scenario, where nuclear construction reaches new heights (IEA, 2023a).

Solar PV capacity takes off in all scenarios, with only wind power at the same scale in the
long term; their variable nature leads to increased deployment of battery storage

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Coal is the largest source of electricity in the world today, accounting for 36% of the total,
but is overtaken by renewables by 2025 in all three scenarios. By 2030, with new construction
slowing and efforts to transition away from coal underway in many countries (IEA, 2022d),
the share of unabated coal in electricity generation falls below 25% in the STEPS, 20% in the
APS and 15% in the NZE Scenario. In STEPS, unabated coal-fired power peaks in China around
2025 and shortly after 2030 in India. Beyond 2030, the use of unabated coal in power
continues to diminish as the largest users – China, India, Indonesia and other emerging
market and developing economies – increasingly look to alternatives.
The role of natural gas in power systems is evolving and varies widely by scenario. Today,
natural gas provides 22% of global electricity as well as flexibility and reliability services, but
gas-fired generation peaks before 2030 in all three scenarios. Its share in total electricity
generation falls to under 20% in 2030 and close to 10% by 2050 in the STEPS, with markets
in advanced economies increasingly looking to gas-fired power plants for flexibility rather
than bulk output as they integrate rising shares of solar PV and wind. While gas-fired power
rises in absolute terms in China and other emerging market and developing economies
beyond 2030, its share gradually declines. In the APS, transitions happen more quickly,
leading to unabated natural gas-fired generation falling by half from 2022 to 2050, and to a
near complete phase out in the NZE Scenario by 2050.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

127

Coal- and gas-fired power plants equipped with CCUS and those co-firing with hydrogen and
ammonia contribute to low-emissions power mainly after 2030. Limited progress is made in
the STEPS, but the pace picks up in the APS and the NZE Scenario. They provide over
1 500 TWh of electricity generation by 2050 in the APS, rising to more than 2 100 TWh in the
NZE Scenario, which is equivalent to all global wind generation today. Along with repurposing
to focus on flexibility and retiring plants early, retrofitting existing coal plants to co-fire
ammonia offers significant opportunities to cut emissions while continuing operations (IEA,
2022d).

Power sector CO2 emissions
Global power sector CO2 emissions were close to 15 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2022 (including both
electricity and heat production), accounting for almost 40% of all energy-related CO2
emissions. Power sector emissions are set to peak in the near term and then start declining
in all scenarios. Weather conditions in major markets will influence the precise timing, for
example droughts could lower hydropower output and temporarily raise the use of fossil
fuels. By 2030, global power sector emissions are down about 15% in the STEPS, 30% in the
APS and 45% in the NZE Scenario, which sees electricity sector emissions subsequently fall to
net zero by 2035 in advanced economies in aggregate, 2040 in China and just before 2045
globally (Figure 3.17). This makes the power sector the first to reach net zero emissions.

Power sector investment
Total power sector investment increases in all scenarios to meet electricity demand growth,
support clean energy transitions and maintain electricity security. Solar PV and wind
currently account for more investment than electricity grids, but projected cost reductions
for solar PV and wind moderate future investment needs at the same time as grid investment
needs rise (Figure 3.18). Grid investment is key to connect millions of new customers and
new renewable sources, reinforce transmission and distribution, and modernise and
digitalise systems (IEA, 2023c). Battery storage attracts increasing investment to provide
hour-to-hour flexibility and grid stability, while investment in unabated fossil fuel power
plants, already low in recent years, drops to a minimal level and is mostly focussed on natural
gas-fired power for the provision of flexibility services. In the STEPS, global power sector
investment rises from USD 1.0 trillion on average over 2018-2022 to USD 1.4 trillion by 2030
and maintains that level through to 2050. In the APS, power sector investment rises to
USD 1.8 trillion by 2030; in the NZE Scenario, it increases further to USD 2.2 trillion.

Global oil markets have been reshaped by the turbulence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic
and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Overall oil demand in 2022 remained slightly below 2019
levels: oil use as a petrochemical feedstock in 2022 was around 1 mb/d higher, but this was
more than offset by lower levels of use in road transport (1 mb/d lower) and aviation (2 mb/d
lower). Demand continued to increase in 2023 and reached a new monthly record in June.
On the supply side, cuts in production by the OPEC+ grouping, which includes Russia and
other exporters, in the first-half of 2023 were largely offset by higher output elsewhere.
Non-OPEC+ increases in supply are expected to be limited during the rest of 2023 despite
further cuts by OPEC+ in July and August.
There are a number of changes in demand and supply trends from the WEO-2022. Oil
demand reaches its maximum level in this Outlook’s STEPS around five years earlier than in
the WEO-2022 and total demand in 2050 is around 5 mb/d lower. This stems mainly from
faster projected increase in EV sales in this Outlook in the light of additional policy support
130

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

as well as plans to establish EV manufacturing hubs in a number of emerging market and
developing economies. On the supply side, the fall in production from Russia is less
immediate than projected in the WEO-2022, but the long-term decline remains similar.
Production by members of OPEC and by countries in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2050
is around 2 mb/d lower in each than projected in the WEO-2022, and production in North
America is around 1 mb/d lower. In this Outlook, oil prices remain flat in the STEPS at around
USD 80/barrel, whereas they gradually fall to USD 60/barrel by 2050 in the APS (Figure 3.19).
In the NZE Scenario, the price gradually falls to the marginal cost of oil production, dropping
to USD 40/barrel in 2030 and trending lower thereafter.

Oil demand and prices peak in the late-2020s in the STEPS;

Demand

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, oil demand reaches its maximum level of 102 mb/d in the late 2020s before
declining slightly to 97 mb/d in 2050, with reduced demand in road transport as a result of
the rise of EVs offset by increased oil use in petrochemicals and in aviation. In practice, this
would probably mean an undulating plateau lasting for many years with demand moving
slightly above and below a long-term average from year to year.
In the APS, there is a much more pronounced decline in demand, which falls to 93 mb/d in
2030 and to 55 mb/d in 2050. Oil demand in road transport modes falls more sharply, with
EVs accounting for more than 75% of passenger car and truck sales in 2050. Only in
petrochemicals and aviation is more oil used in 2050 than in 2022. There are plans to restrict
or ban the production and utilisation of single-use plastics and to scale up plastics recycling,
but these do not prevent an overall increase in global demand for plastics. The use of
sustainable aviation fuels increases, but oil use for aviation nevertheless grows to the

mid‑2030s and then only declines slowly. Maritime oil use falls by 55% between 2022 and
2050, however, and half of the fuels used in ships in 2050 are low-emissions fuels. 6
In the NZE Scenario, oil demand falls to 77 mb/d in 2030. The electrification of cars and trucks
makes a bigger contribution than anything else to reduce oil use, but efficiency
improvements and low-emissions fuels also play an important role, especially in aviation and
shipping. Oil demand falls to just under 25 mb/d in 2050: around 70% of this is accounted for
by the use of oil as a petrochemical feedstock and in products such as paraffin waxes, asphalt
and bitumen where the oil is not combusted.
Across the three scenarios, there is a much wider variation in the demand outlook in
emerging market and developing economies than in advanced economies. Oil demand in
advanced economies declines by between 35-85% through to 2050; in emerging market and
developing economies, it ranges from a 20% increase to a 70% decrease over this period.

of the international situation in countries subject to sanctions, notably Iran and Venezuela,
and production from these countries rises.
In the APS, oil demand declines by 0.5% each year to 2030, but existing sources of supply fall
at a faster rate, which means that new conventional crude oil projects are needed
(Figure 3.21). Guyana is one of the few countries to see an increase in production of more
than 1 mb/d to 2030. There is continued drilling for tight oil in the United States, but
production peaks before 2030 and is around 1.5 mb/d lower in 2050 than 2022 levels.

In the NZE Scenario, oil demand declines by 2.5% each year on average to 2030 and can be
met without any new conventional long lead time oil projects. Production falls across all
regions to 2030. After 2030, oil demand falls by more than 5.5% each year: this is sufficiently
rapid to cause the closure of a number of higher cost projects before they have reached the
end of their technical lifetimes.

Refining, trade and investment
The refining industry enjoyed bumper profits in recent years as a recovery in demand after
the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly for middle distillates such as diesel and kerosene,
coincided with the first net reduction in capacity in 30 years. The industry is now set to add
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

133

more than 6 mb/d of refining capacity, mostly in developing economies in Asia and the
Middle East: however, this wave of capacity additions is likely to be the last, with limited
capacity growth after 2030 projected in all scenarios. Transport fuels have historically been
the main cause of demand growth in refining over the past few decades but this is set to end:
in 2050, the share of gasoline in total demand drops from 25% today to 17% in the STEPS, to
14% in the APS, and to close to zero in the NZE Scenario.
Emerging market and developing economies in Asia currently account for just over 40% of
global crude oil imports. More robust demand and limited domestic production potential
cause this share to rise to 45-60% in 2050 in all scenarios. The Middle East remains the largest
crude oil exporter in all scenarios, but crude oil exports from North America and Latin
America and the Caribbean rise from a 23% share of the total today to 30% in the STEPS in
2050 and 40% in the APS. Russia’s share meanwhile continues to decline. In the NZE Scenario,
the Middle East plays an outsized role in serving global crude oil markets as a low cost
producer, with its share in total exports reaching 65% by 2050. Most of the new refining
facilities currently under development are in product exporting regions, which means the
availability of oil products on the market is set to rise: the decline in product trade is much
more muted than the overall decline in demand in the APS and the NZE Scenario.

Notes: 2023e = estimated values for 2023. New field investment in the NZE Scenario in 2030 is for projects
that are currently under construction or those that are approved before the end of 2023.

At around USD 800 billion, expected oil and natural gas investment levels in 2023 are broadly
aligned with the level needed in the STEPS in 2030, which suggests that the oil and gas
industry today does not yet see a significant near-term reduction in demand as likely
(Figure 3.22). In the APS, investment in new and existing fields is required to avoid supply
134

falling faster than demand, but the overall level of investment in 2030 falls to around
USD 630 billion. In the NZE Scenario, investment in existing fields is needed to ensure that
supply does not decline faster than demand, but no new conventional long lead time oil and
gas projects are developed after 2023 and investment is much lower than today.
Reductions in fossil fuel investment need to be sequenced carefully with the scaling up of
investment in clean energy. Investing more than is needed when clean energy investment is
ramping up and efficiency measures are reducing demand would lead to lower prices and
could also risk lock-in of fossil fuel use. Conversely, reducing fossil fuel investment in advance
of action and investment to reduce demand would lead to much higher and more volatile
prices during energy transitions.

Natural gas markets have been upended by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The sharp reduction
in pipeline supply to Europe tightened global gas markets, resulting in record high prices and
a drop in global demand by around 1% in 2022. Demand fell by a record 13% in Europe, but
there were also ripple effects in emerging markets and developing economies in Asia, where
demand in aggregate fell for the first time ever. Major gas producing regions showed
resilience, with output increasing in the Middle East by 3% and in the United States by 4%.
Global demand remained muted in the first half of 2023; China’s recovery has been uneven,
while a retreat from record natural gas prices in Europe so far has not reinvigorated gas
consumption in the industry or power sectors.
The crisis prompted a scramble by gas importing countries around the world to secure
supplies. This has boosted near-term prospects for additional investment, especially for
liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects. But responses to the crisis have also laid the
groundwork for a more rapid shift away from natural gas in Europe and the United States,
while more upbeat projections for renewables imply weaker natural gas demand growth,
especially in emerging markets in Asia.

Each scenario projects an end to growth for gas; future prospects depend largely on the
pace and scale of growth in clean power, electrification and efficiency improvements.

In the STEPS, natural gas demand growth between 2022 and 2030 is much lower than the
2.2% average rate of growth seen between 2010 and 2021 (Figure 3.23). It reaches a peak by
2030, maintaining a long plateau before gradually declining by around 100 bcm by 2050.
In the APS, demand peaks even sooner, and is 7% lower by 2030 than 2022 levels. In the
NZE Scenario, demand falls by more than 2% per year from 2022 to 2030, and by nearly
8% per year between 2030 and 2040. Decline rates are moderated after 2040 by the growing
use of natural gas with CCUS for the production of low-emissions hydrogen.
136

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Natural gas demand declines in advanced economies in all scenarios. Robust support for
clean energy reduces the share of natural gas in energy supply by 2030 in the power sector
and then increasingly in buildings and industry. There is a continued need for natural gas to
back up variable renewables, and this is often highlighted as a reason for its enduring role in
transitions, but this standby role requires much less consumption of natural gas than
operating plants as baseload supply; moreover, the role of gas in ensuring flexibility over
time is complemented by other options such as batteries and demand response. By 2050,
gas demand in advanced economies falls to 1 200 bcm in the STEPS, 40% below the current
level. More rapid electrification of heat demand and efficiency gains bring gas down to
480 bcm by 2050 in the APS and to 300 bcm in the NZE Scenario. There is a wider range of
possible outcomes for natural gas demand in emerging market and developing economies
(Figure 3.24). Major differences emerge by 2030, at a time when ample new LNG supplies
are anticipated, keeping gas prices low and potentially stimulating robust demand growth.
In the APS and NZE Scenario, this possibility is precluded by rapid growth of renewables in
the power sector, which starts to reduce the market share of natural gas after 2030.

Production

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted major gas producers to bring new supplies to the
market. In 2022, upstream spending outside Russia shot up by more than 15%, with around
half of planned new supply linked to export projects.
In the STEPS, the Middle East emerges as the main source of incremental global supply; its
global share of total production of natural gas rises from 15% in 2022 to 25% by 2050. In the
APS, Middle East production remains resilient as the sole region producing more gas in 2050
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

137

than in 2022 (Figure 3.25). The rate of decline in other regions is determined by the pipeline
of projects under development in the near term, the ability of major producers to find export
outlets in a world where natural gas trade is shrinking, and the cost of developing new
supplies in the long run. Among exporting regions, the United States records impressive
supply growth to 2030 in the STEPS with an increase of 90 bcm in shale and tight gas
production. Over the longer term US production falls, contributing to an overall decline in
production in North America of nearly 400 bcm between 2030 and 2050 – primarily due to
declining domestic demand. The loss of Russian gas supply to Europe and stagnant demand
leads to a 300 bcm drop in Eurasian production by 2050.
In the NZE Scenario, global gas production falls sharply in all regions at a rate that implies
that some projects have to close before reaching the end of their technical lifetimes, though
growing gas use for hydrogen production slows the decline after 2040 in areas where
hydrogen is exported, notably the Middle East and Australia.

Trade and investment
Global natural gas trade in the STEPS increases nearly 15% between 2022 and 2030, which is
half the rate of growth during the previous decade, but more than four-times higher than
growth in overall natural gas demand to 2030 (Figure 3.26). Two-thirds of globally traded
natural gas is delivered as LNG in the STEPS by 2030, up from a level of around 50% in 2021.
Trade is also relatively resilient in the APS and NZE Scenario to 2030: total exports in 2030
are 20 bcm above their 2022 level in the APS and 90 bcm below it in the NZE Scenario.

The United States, which accounts for over 90% of LNG export projects approved since the
start of 2022, solidifies its position as the world’s largest gas exporter through to 2030 in all
scenarios. Although exports also rise in the Middle East, notably from Qatar, most additional
production in the region to 2030 is needed to meet domestic demand. Russia fails to regain
its pre-2022 volumes of total gas exports in any of our scenarios. They fall another 20% by
2030 in the STEPS, as rising deliveries to China through the Power of Siberia pipeline and
modest growth in LNG exports are offset by further declines in pipeline exports to Europe. In
the APS, lower gas demand growth in China and a global surplus of LNG leaves Russia with
few options to diversify into non-European markets: despite modest incremental growth in
exports to Türkiye and Central Asia, total exports fall 25% by 2030. Mozambique emerges as
a large exporter by 2030, but Africa’s overall gas trade balance falls by 2030 in the STEPS as
LNG exports from West Africa decline and a higher share of North African gas production
goes towards meeting domestic demand. In the APS, a dearth of buyers willing to sign up for
new, long lead time export projects means African exports fall one-third below 2022 levels
by 2050.
Since natural gas demand peaks in all WEO scenarios by 2030, there is little headroom
remaining for either pipeline or LNG trade to grow beyond then. With around 650 bcm of
annual liquefaction capacity in operation and a further 250 bcm under construction, global
LNG markets look amply supplied in the STEPS until at least 2040. In the APS, LNG demand
peaks by 2030 and projects under construction today are sufficient to meet demand. In the
NZE Scenario, a global supply glut forms in the mid-2020s and under construction projects
are no longer necessary.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

139

In the STEPS, around USD 190 billion is invested each year to develop upstream gas between
2022 and 2030, and a further USD 40 billion is spent each year on LNG infrastructure. In the
APS, total investment spending falls to 80% of STEPS levels by 2030. In the NZE Scenario,
upstream investment in natural gas is limited to maintaining supply at existing projects and
minimising the emissions intensity of production.
While the sponsors of all LNG projects currently under construction can expect to fully
recover their initial capital investment in the STEPS, around two-thirds of these projects are
at risk of not doing so in the APS, and up to 75% could fail to do so in the NZE Scenario. In
both the APS and NZE Scenario, a good deal of gas would probably end up being sold in an
over-supplied market at close to short-run marginal costs, although the degree of exposure
to volume and price risk between suppliers and off-takers would depend on contractual
arrangements. Some operators, notably in the case of pipelines, can take comfort from
projected spending of USD 100 billion each year on hydrogen transport infrastructure in the
NZE Scenario by 2050: this could provide a route for them to diversify into low-emissions
gases.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

high coal prices and energy security concerns led to renewed coal investment in China and
India, where domestic production was ramped up to reduce reliance on imports, and in
Indonesia, a major supplier of these two economies. Elsewhere, countries did not use much
additional coal, or not for very long: the increase in demand for coal in the European Union
due to the energy crisis in 2022 was equivalent to less than one day of coal demand in China.
Many governments, banks, investors – as well as mining companies – continue to show a lack
of appetite for investment in coal, particularly steam coal (which is mainly used in the power
sector).
Unabated coal is proving to be a difficult fuel to dislodge from the global energy mix. In
advanced economies, there are signs that its share is being structurally eroded by the rapid
rise of renewables, but the overall outlook for coal depends to a large extent on
developments in emerging market and developing economies. China is especially important
in this context, since it accounts for at least half of all coal demand throughout the Outlook
period across all scenarios. In the power sector, coal transitions are complicated by the
relatively young age of coal plants across much of the Asia Pacific region: plants in developing
economies in Asia are on average less than 15 years old.

Demand
The outlook for coal is heavily dependent on the strength of the world’s resolve to address
climate change (Figure 3.27). In the STEPS, coal demand declines gradually. In the APS, it
drops 25% below current levels by 2030, and 75% by 2050; coal demand peaks in China in
the mid-2020s and in India in the late 2020s. In the NZE Scenario, global demand falls by
around 45% by 2030 and 90% by 2050.

In advanced economies, coal-fired power plants are rapidly replaced by renewables and
other low-emissions alternatives in the power sector in all scenarios, and there is a continued
focus on replacing coal in the industry sector, where new technologies and efficiency gains
help to reduce coal demand in steel production and other industries. In China, coal use also
falls in all scenarios, with progress speeding up in the APS from 2030 and in the NZE Scenario
from now onwards. In India and other emerging market and developing economies, the
outlook for coal varies markedly between scenarios. In the STEPS, coal demand increases to
the mid-2030s and then mostly plateaus, with reductions in the power sector being offset by
higher demand from the industry sector. In the APS and NZE Scenario, patterns of coal
demand are similar to those seen in China.
There is very limited use of CCUS with coal in the STEPS. Around 400 million tonnes of coal
equivalent (Mtce) of coal demand in 2050 is equipped with CCUS in both the APS and NZE
Scenario: this equates to around 25% of demand in the APS and more than 80% in the NZE
Scenario. Unabated coal use drops by over 98% between 2021 and 2050 in the NZE Scenario.

Production
Global coal production rose above 6 billion tonnes of coal equivalent in 2022, its highest level
ever. Energy prices and energy security concerns led China, India, Indonesia and other major
coal producers to expand domestic supply, but this increase in supply may be short lived
(Figure 3.28). New mine developments, especially those which would produce steam coal,
are facing concerns about future demand, difficulties accessing finance and scrutiny on
environmental, social and governance issues.

In the STEPS, global coal supply falls gradually to 2030, with increases in India offset by
reductions in advanced economies, and then drops by about 30% from 2030 to 2050. In the
APS, supply declines by 30% to 2030 and by 75% to 2050, compared to 2022 levels. Steam
coal falls by over 3 750 Mtce by 2050 (75% reduction), while coking coal falls by less than
650 Mtce (65% reduction). Production in China falls by 2 680 Mtce (80% reduction),
accounting for close to 60% of the global decline in supply. Production in India falls by
260 Mtce (60% reduction). The leading exporters, Australia and Indonesia, see production
fall by around 85% and 65% respectively between 2022 and 2050. In the NZE Scenario, global
coal production declines by 45% to 2030 and a further 85% between 2030 and 2050.
Remaining production in 2050 is around 400 Mtce of steam coal and 100 Mtce of coking coal.

Trade
The Asia Pacific region is the main driver of international coal trade, accounting for around
three-quarters of global coal imports in 2022 (Figure 3.29). China was the largest importer
(around 230 Mtce), while Australia and Indonesia were the two main coal exporters,
together accounting for 60% of coal exports in 2022. Australia alone provided half of all
coking coal exports.

economies: Australian exports, which are around 50% coking coal, increase by 5% to 2050,
while Indonesia, mainly a steam coal exporter, sees exports fall by 40%.
In the APS, global coal trade falls by 30% to 2030 and by 65% to 2050 compared to 2022.
Around 420 Mtce of coal is imported in 2050, mainly by countries with large distances
between domestic production and consumption hubs and where differences in coal quality
require domestic production to be supplemented with imports. Imports of coking coal in
India increase by more than 55% to 2030 as it expands steel production. Indonesian exports
drop by nearly 35% to 2030 as the market for steam coal shrinks. Australia produces a higher
proportion of coking coal than Indonesia and initially fares better, with coal exports falling
by 5% to 2030, although its exports subsequently fall by over 45% between 2030 and 2050.
In the NZE Scenario, global coal trade declines by 90% between 2022 and 2050 as clean
energy technologies progressively and speedily displace coal across the energy system. In
2050, advanced economies import small quantities of coal that is mostly used with CCUS to
produce steel or supply power during demand peaks.

Investment
Despite renewed interest in 2022, investment in coal supply and coal-fired power worldwide
has fallen around 15% since 2015. Most new projects in recent years have been in China and
India, which together accounted for around 80% of global investment in coal-fired power
plants and supply in 2022 (Figure 3.30).

Modern bioenergy

Modern bioenergy comes in solid, liquid and gaseous forms. Together these fuels make up
more than half of global renewables supply today. Overall production increased 5% in 2022
to reach 40 EJ.
Solid bioenergy currently accounts for the vast majority of production. It is mostly derived
from organic waste sources, such as forestry residues or municipal solid waste, and often
pelletised for use in power generation or industry, with a small but important share used in
the buildings sector. In the STEPS, modern solid bioenergy reaches 44 EJ in 2030 and 57 EJ in
2050. In the APS and the NZE Scenario, production rises to more than 70 EJ by 2050. This
provides dispatchable renewable power, a cost-competitive source of clean heat for industry
and an alternative to the traditional use of solid biomass in emerging market and developing
economies.

Liquid biofuels production increased by nearly 5% in 2022 to 2.2 mboe/d. In the STEPS,
production increases at around 4% annually, reaching 3 mboe/d in 2030 and over 4 mboe/d
in 2050. In the APS, it rises faster as liquid biofuels are increasingly used to help meet
Nationally Determined Contribution and net zero emissions targets. In the NZE Scenario,
liquid biofuels use expands more rapidly to 2030 than in the APS but then decreases below
the level in the APS by 2050. The reduced demand for liquid biofuels in the NZE Scenario in
2050 compared with the APS is driven by several factors, including faster uptake of EVs, more
rapid efficiency improvements in road vehicles, shipping vessels and airplanes, and reduced
demand for aviation due to behaviour change.
Biogas and biomethane are the smallest part of the bioenergy supply chain, but there is
growing interest in biomethane in particular as a source of low-emissions domestic gas

supply, especially in Europe. Worldwide around 300 bcm of potential production from
agricultural wastes and residues lies within 20 kilometres of major gas pipeline
infrastructure, providing a good match with possible large-scale production and injection
into gas networks (Figure 3.32). In the STEPS, combined biogas and biomethane production
nearly doubles by 2030 to reach 80 billion cubic metres equivalent (bcme). In all scenarios,
the share of biomethane in total biogas demand increases, driven in large part by the value
attached to its use as a dispatchable source of energy and drop-in substitute for natural gas.
In the APS, total biomethane production reaches 240 bcme by 2050; in the NZE Scenario, this
rises to nearly 300 bcme.

Total modern bioenergy supply is around 65 EJ in the APS by 2030 and over 70 EJ in the
NZE Scenario (Figure 3.31). By 2050, the total sustainable potential assessed by the IEA of
around 100 EJ is fully exploited in both the APS and the NZE Scenario, with large increases in
the use of organic wastes and short rotation woody crops more than offsetting a decline in
the use of conventional bioenergy crops and the traditional use of solid biomass. Around 10%
of total bioenergy use in the NZE Scenario is equipped with bioenergy carbon capture and
storage (BECCS) by 2050, and this plays a critical role in offsetting residual emissions. The
share of advanced liquid biofuels in total production rises from more than 10% today to 55%
in 2050 in the APS and around 75% in the NZE Scenario. In all scenarios, maximising the use
of advanced biofuels helps to expand biofuel production in a way that has minimal impact
on land use, food and feed prices. 7
7 Advanced biofuels are produced from non‐food crop feedstocks, which can deliver significant life cycle
greenhouse gas emissions savings compared with fossil fuel alternatives and do not directly compete with
food and feed crops for agricultural land or cause adverse sustainability impacts.

Key clean energy technology trends

Solar PV and wind
Solar PV and wind are set to dominate power capacity additions. Globally, they account for
over 70% of total capacity additions between now and 2050 in all WEO scenarios. They do so
because they are now the cheapest new sources of electricity in most markets, widely
available and enjoy policy support in over 140 countries.
Global solar PV capacity additions, including both rooftop solar and utility-scale projects,
reached a record high of 220 GW in 2022, twice the level in 2019 and more than seven-times
the level ten years earlier. In the STEPS, capacity additions rise to 500 GW in 2030 and
580 GW in 2050: this includes replacements of solar panels that typically last 20-30 years
(Figure 3.33). In the APS, capacity additions rise faster, reaching 640 GW in 2030 and 770 GW
in 2050. In the NZE Scenario, capacity additions reach 820 GW by 2030 and the same level is
achieved in 2050. Solar PV on buildings, including rooftops, represents about half of total
solar PV capacity additions today, and this more than doubles to 2030 in all three scenarios.
Off-grid solar home systems play a vital role in closing electricity access gaps in sub-Saharan
Africa, and their use increases too (see Chapter 4, section 4.4). However, utility-scale projects
make up the majority of new solar capacity in all scenarios, in large part because of their
significantly lower levelised costs of electricity.

Solar PV and wind capacity additions double by 2030 in the STEPS
and expand nearly fourfold in the NZE Scenario

China is the largest solar PV market, accounting for 45% of all capacity additions in 2022. It
maintains its leading role in all scenarios, accounting for about half of global cumulative
additions from 2023 to 2050 in the STEPS and about 40% in the APS. Its rapid growth in
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

deployment is supported by huge domestic solar manufacturing capacity (see Chapter 1).
In 2022, the next largest markets for solar PV were the European Union (17% of global
additions), United States (9%) and India (8%). These remain leading markets in all scenarios,
complemented by increasing deployment in Southeast Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Global wind capacity additions dropped to 75 GW in 2022. While this level is nearly a third
below the peak in 2020, it remains above deployment levels before 2020. By the end of this
decade, global wind capacity additions rise to 175 GW per year in the STEPS as technology
continues to improve and costs to fall, though additional manufacturing capacity is required
to meet this level of demand. By 2050, annual deployment levels reach 195 GW, taking into
account replacements of ageing wind turbines. In the APS, 240 GW of wind capacity are
added in 2030, increasing to 310 GW in 2050. In the NZE Scenario, these figures rise to
320 GW in 2030 and 350 GW in 2050. Offshore installations account for just 15% of wind
capacity additions today, but their share roughly doubles by 2030 across all scenarios.
China is the largest market for wind power, as it is for solar PV. It accounted for half of global
capacity additions in 2022 and is responsible for around 40% of global cumulative wind
capacity additions from 2023 to 2050 in the STEPS and around 28% in the APS. The European
Union (18% of global additions), United States (11%) and Brazil (4%) were other leading
markets in 2022 and continue to be so across all scenarios.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Scaling up and maintaining much higher levels of solar PV and wind power generation
requires action to address a number of barriers, including those related to:


Permitting and licensing of new projects. Work to complete the necessary regulatory
steps for new projects, including environmental assessments where applicable, can
delay individual projects by years and slow market growth. Standardising and
streamlining these processes, while ensuring that they involve local communities, will
be critical to clean energy transitions (IEA, 2023a).



Grid development and connections. Modernising, digitalising and reinforcing existing
electricity networks can take years, and the same is true for the addition of new grid
connections. Streamlining permitting and licensing processes would help with this, but
timely grid development also calls for improved long-term planning and the scaling up
of investment to support the rapid deployment of wind and solar PV (IEA, 2023c).



Expanding wind manufacturing capacity and improving the financial health of wind
supply chains. Despite low levelised costs of electricity and recent market growth, the
manufacture of turbines and other equipment needed for wind power involves thin
profit margins as a result of uncertainty about commodity prices and the way that
auction schemes are operated. Measures to mitigate these risks, including through
contract terms, are needed to ensure that they do not endanger the wind industry and
impede clean energy transitions.



Enhancing power system flexibility to integrate rising shares of solar PV and wind. Action
to enhance power system flexibility is essential to make the best use of solar PV and
wind. Battery storage and demand response have a major part to play in meeting short-

148

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

term flexibility needs, while hydropower and thermal sources will play a central part in
the provision of seasonal flexibility (see Chapter 4). Reliable supplies of critical minerals
will also be essential.

Electric vehicles
The share of EVs cars in global car sales more than tripled to 14% in the last two years. Further
record sale levels are expected in 2023, particularly in the United States. China is the most
important market for electric cars: more than half of all the electric cars on the road today
are in China, which has already exceeded its 2025 target for new energy vehicle sales.
In the STEPS, nearly 40 million electric cars are purchased in 2030, accounting for nearly 40%
of all vehicle sales. This is well above the 25% projection for 2030 in the WEO-2022 and not
far behind the level of purchases in the APS (Figure 3.34). This more optimistic outlook is due
to new voluntary EV targets by major automakers as well as new vehicle standards, mandates
and subsidies in China, European Union and United States. In the NZE Scenario, the share of
electric cars account for two-thirds of total sales by 2030. If they all come to fruition, plans
that have been announced for battery manufacturing capacity would be sufficient to meet
demand for EV batteries in the NZE Scenario in 2030.

set to continue as infrastructure requirements and cost premiums are limited. However, less

deployment of charging infrastructure is needed to increase the rate of heavy trucks
electrification, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Deployment levels
are higher for electric buses, which are already cost competitive on a lifetime basis and are
often subsidised by local municipalities.

Heat pumps
Global sales of heat pumps in the buildings sector increased by 11% in 2022, marking the
second year of double-digit growth for this central technology in the world’s transition to
secure and sustainable heating. Heat pumps overtook sales of fossil fuel-based heating
systems in key markets such as France and the United States, while sales doubled in various
European countries where financial incentives and bans on fossil fuel boilers have helped to
build momentum (section 3.3.3). Manufacturing capacity is expanding rapidly, and further
announcements from key manufacturers are expected, driven by new deployment targets,
direct industry support and incentives for consumers.

Today, heat pumps account for around 10% of sales of residential heating equipment
worldwide. Sales growth is particularly strong for air-to-water heat pumps in Europe where
they typically replace gas-fired boilers. By 2030, the share of heat pumps in heating
equipment sales is set to more than double in the STEPS and to reach around a third in the
APS (Figure 3.35). The global installed capacity of heat pumps more than doubles by 2030 in
the STEPS from around 1 000 gigawatts thermal (GWth) in 2022, while APS deployment levels
are close to 2 500 GWth by 2030. Between 2022 and 2030, global heat pump deployment
saves more than 5 EJ of fossil fuels in the APS. However, upfront costs often remain high,
150

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

particularly for low income households, while the design of electricity tariffs and energy
taxation still put heat pumps at a disadvantage relative to fossil fuel boilers in some
countries. Meeting existing targets also requires more installers and faster progress in colder
climates, multi-family apartment buildings and homes with retrofit requirements. Efforts are
ramped up further to tackle these obstacles in the NZE Scenario, where the global heat pump
stock expands to nearly 3 000 GWth by 2030: more than two-thirds of which is installed in
advanced economies.

Hydrogen
Progress in scaling up low-emissions hydrogen continues apace, with investment in projects
reaching USD 1 billion in 2022 and a raft of new policies around the world boosting
confidence. 8 In May 2023, a new record was set for the world’s largest operational
electrolyser plant – a 260 megawatt facility in China that will replace hydrogen from natural
gas in an oil refinery – and a 2 GW project in Saudi Arabia reached a final investment decision
after the company, Air Products, agreed to shoulder the off-take risk for its ammonia trade.
Increasingly, such projects are linked to dedicated renewable electricity supplies rather than
relying mostly on the electricity grid. If all announced projects come to fruition, more than
400 GW of electrolysis could be operational by 2030. Two projects in Canada and the
United States have started construction to produce hydrogen from natural gas with a target
of 95% CO2 capture, which would result in a combined hydrogen capacity equivalent to
1.4 GW of electrolysis (at a 90% capacity factor) (IEA, 2023d).
The near-term outlook is clouded by cost inflation, uncertainty around policy details and
supply chain bottlenecks. In the STEPS, 7 Mt of low-emissions hydrogen is produced in 2030,
most of which replaces existing supplies of hydrogen for ammonia plants and refineries
(Figure 3.36). In the APS, low-emissions hydrogen demand reaches 25 Mt in 2030, and this
rises in the NZE Scenario to 69 Mt. These trajectories depend on much stronger policies than
those in the STEPS to bolster demand, finance demonstration projects and support
infrastructure expansion.
Dilemmas facing electrolyser manufacturers illustrate some of the value chain challenges for
low-emissions hydrogen. Taken together, the available manufacturing capacities announced
by electrolyser manufacturers total 14 GW, half of which is in China, where the domestic
market is increasing rapidly. However, output to date has been much lower, estimated at
just above 1 GW in 2022, and many of the plants in development are progressing slowly
because hydrogen producers are reluctant to commit to electrolyser purchase contracts at
current prices, which have risen due to inflation. Meanwhile, a fall in natural gas prices and
a corresponding increase in relative costs for electrolysis hydrogen have spurred competition
to maintain profit margins among players along the value chain. Without the opportunity to
get large-scale systems installed quickly and used commercially, manufacturers cannot

8 Low-emissions hydrogen includes: those produced from water using electricity generated by renewables or

nuclear, bioenergy, other fuels equipped to avoid greenhouse gas emissions, e.g. via CCUS with a high capture
rate and low upstream methane emissions; other sources with an equivalent CO2 intensity (IEA, 2023e).
Demand for low-emissions hydrogen includes its use to produce hydrogen-based fuels.

accumulate sufficient operating hours to provide industry standard performance guarantees,
exacerbating risks and inflating costs for the most efficient designs. The scale-up of
production in all scenarios is predicated on a break in this cycle and better co-ordination of
manufacturing investments, low-emissions hydrogen production projects and demand
creation.

Carbon capture, utilisation and storage

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

For the first time in a decade, multiple CCUS projects are in construction around the world.
Total investment in projects reached a record USD 3 billion in 2022. The outlook for CCUS is
for continued growth. Momentum is fuelled by activity in North America, where more
generous tax credits and new grant funding programmes are the driving forces behind
announcements of over 100 projects across the CCUS value chain since January 2022. The
global project pipeline now represents over 400 Mt CO2 capture capacity vying to be online
by 2030. In the United States, where a fixed amount of funding is available per tonne of CO2
safely stored, many of the projects focus on capturing CO2 from bioethanol and hydrogen
production, since these are among the cheapest options. Notable progress also is being made
elsewhere, with investment in large-scale projects in Canada and China, and key regulatory
advances in Canada, Denmark, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia.
Current policies, however, are wholly insufficient to support the outcomes that match
government net zero emissions pledges. In the STEPS, CCUS deployment grows nearly
threefold from the 40 Mt CO2 captured in 2022 to 115 Mt CO2 in 2030 (Figure 3.37), three152

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

quarters of which is in North America and Asia Pacific. This increase is dwarfed by the
projections in the APS, which sees CCUS increase more than tenfold in the period to 2030.The
APS also projects more regional diversity, with the share of captured CO2 in Europe rising to
above 15% of the global total, over half of it in the European Union. The requirements of the
NZE Scenario are even more ambitious, as more countries and sectors adopt best available
technologies to mitigate emissions from industrial plants and to meet global demand for lowemissions hydrogen. In the NZE Scenario, around 1 Gt CO2 is captured in 2030, including
265 Mt CO2 from bioenergy and direct air capture, almost 90% of which is geologically stored.

More CCUS projects become competitive as climate ambitions rise and sectors need to
fully mitigate emissions; NZE Scenario projects 6 Gt CO2/year captured and stored by 2050

Reaching the levels of CCUS projected in the APS and NZE Scenario requires strong policy
support, including measures to facilitate strategic investment in infrastructure. For example,
the total length of existing CO2 pipelines is 9 500 kilometres (km), which needs to increase to
between 100 000 and 600 000 km in order to facilitate the storage of 5.5 Gt CO2 and
utilisation of a further 0.6 Gt CO2 in the NZE Scenario by 2050 (IEA, 2023f). The high end of
this range is a similar order of magnitude to the more than 1 million km of natural gas
transmission pipelines that have come online over the past century. Enabling such a huge
scale-up, and a parallel investment in seaborne CO2 transport, requires new businesses that
offer commercial CO2 transport and storage services. There are signs that these are emerging
in some regions, exemplified by the development of the Northern Lights CO2 storage
resource in Norway, where there are now agreements that could lead to CO2 being
transported to the site from facilities in Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and United Kingdom.
The European Commission has proposed that oil and gas producers take legal responsibility
for ensuring the development of European CO2 storage resources, initially targeting
50 Mt CO2/year of capacity by 2030. Policy developments of this type have the potential to
accelerate progress.

Secure and people-centred energy transitions
Critical ingredients for success
S U M M A R Y
• Secure energy transitions depend on keeping the global average surface temperature
rise below 1.5 °C. The temperature today is around 1.2 °C above pre-industrial levels,
and global emissions have not yet peaked. In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), the
temperature rises to 1.9 °C in 2050 and 2.4 °C in 2100. This is 0.1 °C lower than
projected in the STEPS from the World Energy Outlook-2022, but far above the levels
of the Paris Agreement. In the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), the temperature
rise in 2100 is 1.7 °C; in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, the
temperature peaks in mid-century and falls to around 1.4 °C in 2100.

• Energy transitions do not bring an end to traditional risks to energy security. Global
oil and gas trade becomes increasingly focussed on flows between the Middle East
and Asia, exposing importers to a variety of risks. Electricity faces rising short-term
flexibility needs which can be met through demand response and storage, and rising
seasonal flexibility needs which can be met by hydropower and thermal sources, all
enabled by expanding and modernising grids.

• Energy transitions also bring new risks to energy security. One set of risks relate to
supply chains for clean energy technologies and for critical minerals. Supply chains for
both are highly geographically concentrated. Diversified investment to meet growing
demand can help, but international partnerships will also be necessary.

• Another set of risks relate to the people-centred aspects of energy transitions,

including what they mean for access, affordability and employment. The number of
people without access to clean cooking (2.3 billion) and electricity (760 million) today
fall by around 15% to 2030 in the STEPS, by two-thirds in the APS, and to zero in the
NZE Scenario in response to measures to improve access. Household energy bills in
advanced economies fall by nearly 20% in the STEPS to 2030, as fossil fuel use drops
and energy efficiency gains accrue. In emerging market and developing economies,
fossil fuel subsidies need to be phased out carefully to limit impacts on household
budgets. Estimates of new jobs created range from 7 million in the STEPS to 30 million
in the NZE Scenario: these increases outweigh losses in fossil fuel and related
industries but will often be in new locations and require new skills.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Prospects for secure and people-centred energy transitions depend on securing high

levels of investment. Energy investment levels show encouraging trends for
renewables and electric vehicles, but there are large energy investment gaps in
emerging market and developing economies other than China, and investment in
most end-use areas is lagging in all regions. The expected level of oil and gas
investment in 2023 is similar to the amounts required in the STEPS in 2030 and far
above the levels needed in the APS and NZE Scenario, implying that the oil and gas
industry does not expect there to be any significant near-term reduction in demand.

Introduction

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine turned strains in energy supply related to the Covid-19 pandemic
into a full-blown energy crisis. Consumers around the world were exposed to higher energy
bills and supply shortages, providing a stark reminder of the importance of secure, affordable
and people-centred energy transitions, and of the risks that could undermine such
transitions. Traditional risks to energy security do not disappear in energy transitions, and
there are potential new vulnerabilities in a more electrified and renewables-rich system. New
risks arise in addition from the impact that our changing climate is producing on weather
patterns. Successful transitions also depend on placing people at the centre of discussions
about the future of energy: they cannot be achieved without sustained support and
participation from citizens, and particular help is needed for those that currently lack access
to modern energy services.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

This chapter examines several key aspects of people-centred and secure energy transitions.
It is divided into four sections:


First, it highlights the nature and scale of the risks posed in our projections by a range of
energy-related environmental hazards, including carbon dioxide and methane
emissions, and examines their implications for the global temperature rise and air
pollution.



Second, it reviews how traditional and new energy security hazards play out in the
scenario projections. Traditional fuel security risks persist against a backdrop of more
fragmented international energy markets, while new risks arise for electricity security
as both power supply and demand become more variable. In addition, there are major
uncertainties about the resilience of clean energy supply chains, including for critical
minerals.



The third section further develops the people-centred aspects of energy transitions,
starting with the provision of access to electricity and to clean cooking fuels. It examines
the implications of the scenario projections for the affordability of energy supply and
energy employment, as well as the behavioural changes needed to achieve rapid energy
transitions.



Ultimately, the prospects for affordable, sustainable and secure energy supply boil down
to questions about investment. The fourth section discusses capital flows to the energy
sector and looks at what faster energy transitions mean for investment in fossil fuels.

Emissions trajectory and temperature outcomes

Emissions and temperature outcomes by scenario
The global average surface temperature rise now stands at around 1.2 degrees Celsius (°C)
above pre-industrial levels. This year has seen a number of extreme weather events,
including heat waves and droughts in many parts of the world. These have had major impacts
on those affected by them. They have also put significant strain on power systems by
curtailing supply from sources like hydro and thermal power, and dramatically increasing
demand for space cooling.
Global energy-related CO2 emissions rose to an all-time high of 37 gigatonnes of carbon
dioxide (Gt CO2) in 2022. In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), emissions remain largely flat
until the late 2020s and then decline slowly to 30 Gt CO2 in 2050. In the Announced Pledges
Scenario (APS), emissions fall by just over 2% per year to 31 Gt CO2 in 2030 and then fall
further to 12 Gt CO2 in 2050. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, emissions
drop by more than 5% per year to 24 Gt CO2 in 2030 and then fall to net zero in 2050
(Figure 4.1). The NZE Scenario also assumes rapid reductions in CO2 emissions from land use,
which reach net zero just after 2030, and in emissions of all non-CO2 greenhouse gases.

In the STEPS, the global average surface temperature increases to 1.9 °C above pre-industrial
levels around 2050 and is on track for 2.4 °C in 2100 and still higher temperatures thereafter. 1
Inherent uncertainties in the earth’s response to future emissions mean that there is a
one-third probability of the temperature rise exceeding 2.6 °C in the STEPS in 2100, and a
one-in-twenty chance of it exceeding 3.5 °C. In the APS, the temperature rises more slowly,
especially after 2030, and reaches around 1.7 °C in 2100. In the NZE Scenario, the
temperature rise peaks just below 1.6 °C around 2040 before falling back to around 1.4 °C in
2100. All further temperature rises carry risks: those in the STEPS would risk particularly
extreme consequences for global ecosystems and human well-being.

How big are the implementation and ambition gaps?
The Paris Agreement requires all countries to develop, submit and implement Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs) and to set a schedule for updating them to increase
ambition. As of September 2023, 168 NDCs had been submitted, covering 195 Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and nearly 90% had
been updated since the first NDC round.

1 Temperature rise estimates quoted in this section refer to the median temperature rise calculated using the

Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC 7.5.3). All changes in
temperatures are relative to 1850‐1900 and match the IPCC 6th Assessment Report definition of warming of
0.85 °C between 1995‐2014 (IPCC, 2021).

Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

The most recent submissions have lowered projected emissions in 2030 by around 5 Gt CO2
from the NDCs first submitted in 2016, if all targets conditional on international support are
reached (Figure 4.2). For advanced economies, achieving the revised NDCs would lower
emissions in 2030 by around 2.1 Gt CO2 compared with the first submissions. In emerging
market and developing economies, emissions in 2030 under the revised NDCs would be
around 2.8 Gt CO2 lower than in the first round of submissions.
In advanced economies, there is a 0.7 Gt CO2 gap between emissions projected for 2030 in
the revised NDCs and the STEPS, which indicates that countries have not yet introduced all
the specific policies needed to achieve their NDCs. In emerging market and developing
economies, the situation is reversed, with emissions in the STEPS projections 1 Gt CO2 lower
in 2030 than under their revised unconditional NDCs. This indicates that their current policies
provide scope for their NDCs to be made more ambitious.
In both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies, there is a
large implementation gap between the STEPS and the APS and a large ambition gap between
the APS and the NZE Scenario. In advanced economies, there is an implementation gap of
1.7 Gt CO2 in 2030 and an ambition gap of 1.8 Gt CO2. In emerging market and developing
economies, there is an implementation gap of 2.5 Gt CO2 in 2030 and an ambition gap of
close to 5 Gt CO2. This suggests that more ambition on net zero emissions pledges is required
by countries around the world, and that countries need to do much more to back up their
pledges with firm policy commitments and measures to ensure their realisation..

In both scenarios, about 40% of total emissions reductions in emerging market
and developing economies come from renewables replacing coal power

160

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

The largest single contribution to closing the ambition and the implementation gaps in both
the APS and the NZE Scenario comes from replacing coal‐fired power generation with
renewable energy sources. In emerging market and developing economies, the switch to
clean sources of electricity makes up 40% of total emissions reductions between today and
2030 in both scenarios (Figure 4.3).
In the APS, most of the remaining emissions reductions compared with the STEPS come from
more rapid energy efficiency improvements and the electrification of end‐uses. Heavy
industry contributes the largest share of reductions, reflecting more stringent efficiency
standards than in the STEPS and wider deployment of large‐scale near zero emissions plants
in energy‐intensive industries.
In the NZE Scenario, there are large additional emissions reductions from cars and trucks,
particularly in advanced economies, reflecting a faster roll out of electric vehicles (EVs) and
supporting infrastructure. In hard‐to‐abate sectors, such as aviation and shipping, the risks
associated with being a first mover deter some firms from adopting innovative low‐emissions
technologies during this decade in the APS, but measures taken in the NZE Scenario counter
these risks and contribute emissions reductions of 0.5 Gt CO2 globally.

4.2.2

Methane abatement

What is the outlook for methane emissions from fossil fuels?
Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial
Revolution; rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting
near-term global warming (IPCC, 2021). The energy sector accounts for nearly 40% of
methane emissions from human activity. Methane emissions from fossil fuel operations
account for the vast majority of energy sector emissions, and indeed for nearly 10% of total
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector. We estimate that the fossil fuel
industry could avoid more than 70% of its current methane emissions with existing
technology, much of it at little or no net cost.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Methane emissions from fossil fuel operations fall in all scenarios from 2023 to 2030: in the
STEPS by around 20%; in the APS by 40%; and in the NZE Scenario by 75% (Figure 4.4). Around
one-third of the reductions in the NZE Scenario are due to reduced demand for oil, gas and
coal and two-thirds are from the rapid deployment of emissions reduction measures and
technologies. Some of the key measures include a stop to all non-emergency flaring and
venting, and universal adoption of regular leak detection and repair programmes. By 2030,
all fossil fuel producers reduce their methane emission intensities to levels similar to the
world’s best operators today.
China and Russia are the two largest emitters of methane from fossil fuels. Together they
accounted for around one-third of methane emissions from fossil fuel operations in 2022.
Neither has committed to absolute methane reductions before 2030. However, many
countries that have net zero emissions goals also are not currently doing enough to address
methane emissions.

If countries make good on their pledges, methane emissions will fall by
around 50 Mt to 2030; they fall an additional 45 Mt in the NZE Scenario
Note: Mt = million tonnes.

How can cutting methane from fossil fuels contribute to the Global Methane Pledge?
The Global Methane Pledge was launched at COP26 in November 2021 to catalyse action to
reduce methane emissions. Led by the United States and the European Union, 150 countries
are now participants and together are responsible for more than half of global methane
emissions from human activity. By joining the Pledge, countries commit to work together to
collectively reduce methane emissions by at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Achieving the 75% cut in methane emissions from fossil fuel operations in the NZE Scenario
would lower total human-caused methane emissions by more than 25% (Figure 4.5).
Generally, many of these reductions can be achieved at very low cost or while generating
overall savings. Based on average natural gas prices from 2017 to 2021, around 40% of
emissions from oil and gas operations could be avoided at no net cost because the outlays
for the abatement measures are less than the market value of the additional gas that is
captured.
Emissions could be reduced very quickly if countries and companies were to adopt a set of
tried and tested measures and policy tools related to leak detection and repair requirements,
technology standards, and a ban on non-emergency flaring and venting. In the oil and gas
sector, these measures would cut methane emissions from operations by half. If adopted
worldwide in the coal sector, around half of methane emissions could be cut by making the
most of the potential to use coal mine methane in mining operations, or by making use of
flaring or oxidation technologies. Advances in technology, such as improved satellite
coverage for leak monitoring, are making it easier to pinpoint sources of emissions and to
facilitate abatement in both sectors, but action so far has been slow.

(UNEP, 2021). Emissions from biofuel and biomass burning are not shown.

What is needed to increase action on methane?
Methane abatement in the energy sector is one of the best options available to reduce GHG
emissions (Figure 4.6). Just over USD 75 billion in cumulative spending is required to 2030 to
cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations by 75% in the NZE Scenario, which is less
than 2% of the net income received by this industry in 2022 (IEA, 2023a).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There are a variety of reasons why methane emissions from fossil fuel operations have
remained stubbornly high in recent years, including information gaps, inadequate
infrastructure or underdeveloped local markets that make it difficult to find a productive use
for abated gas, and misaligned investment incentives that, for example, rule out any
spending that does not provide a quick payback.
There are various ways to speed up progress. There is a role for governments in
implementing and enforcing policies and regulations to incentivise or require early company
action, but oil, gas and coal companies carry primary responsibility for methane abatement
and should move quickly towards a zero tolerance approach to methane emissions without
waiting until legislation compels them to do so. Banks, investors and insurers have an
opportunity to add to the pressure for more rapid action by incorporating methane
abatement into their engagement with the hydrocarbon industries with the aim of
promoting strict performance standards, verifiable methane reductions, and transparent and
comparable disclosures on measured emissions. There is also scope for consumers to work
with suppliers to create a market for certified low-emissions fuels and to provide economic
incentives for methane abatement.

VRUs = vapour recovery units. One tonne of methane is considered to be equivalent to 30 tonnes of CO2 based
on the 100‐year global warming potential (IPCC, 2021).

Of the total USD 75 billion required spending on methane abatement to 2030 in the
NZE Scenario, we estimate that about USD 15-20 billion will be hard to finance through
traditional channels (IEA, 2023a). This includes spending required in low and middle income
countries, at facilities owned and operated by national oil companies and smaller
independent companies, and for measures that generate a small return over their lifetime.
A new international effort is needed from the industry, governments and other stakeholders
to fill this financing gap.

4.2.3

Air quality

Overview and scenario outcomes
Air pollution is one of the world’s most significant environmental risks to human health, with
one-in-nine deaths linked to poor air quality. Over 90% of people are exposed to polluted
air, 2 leading to more than 6 million premature deaths a year – more than twice the number
of deaths during 2020 from Covid-19. Air pollution also compounds multiple chronic health
conditions, such as asthma, and leads to serious diseases, such as lung cancer.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Today, about 4.4 million premature deaths a year are caused by breathing polluted air from
outdoor sources (ambient air pollution), and around 3.2 million are the result of breathing
polluted air from indoor sources (household air pollution) due mainly to the traditional use
2 Polluted air is defined here as having a PM
3
2.5 concentration higher than 5 µg/m .

164

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

of biomass for heating and cooking. The majority of premature deaths from ambient air
pollution and almost all of those from household air pollution are in emerging market and
developing economies, where air pollution also comes with a significant economic cost. It is
estimated to reduce global gross domestic product (GDP) by around 6%, and the GDP of some
emerging market and developing economies by more than 10% per year (World Bank, 2022).
In the STEPS, premature deaths attributable to ambient air pollution increase to 4.9 million
in 2030, while premature deaths due to household air pollution fall to around 2.5 million
(Figure 4.7). These worldwide results mask strong regional differences. Around 1% of people
in advanced economies have long‐term exposure today to fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
concentrations exceeding 35 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3), the least stringent
interim target of the World Health Organization (WHO, 2021), which remains largely
unchanged to 2030 in the STEPS. In contrast, 40% of people in emerging market and
developing economies breathe air with concentrations of PM2.5 above the least stringent
WHO target today. In the STEPS this reduces only marginally to 37% in 2030 as reductions in
PM2.5 emissions are offset by increases in the urban population.

above the least stringent WHO target from 2022 levels by 230 million (or 3% of the global
population) in 2030. Premature deaths from household air pollution in the APS are around
1.3 million lower than in the STEPS in 2030, and deaths associated with ambient air pollution
are about 200 000 lower than in the STEPS.
In the NZE Scenario, the next decade brings dramatic reductions in premature deaths both
from ambient and indoor air pollution. By 2030 there are 2.5 million fewer premature deaths
from household air pollution per year than in 2022, and around 1.7 million fewer premature
deaths from ambient air pollution. The benefits are largest in emerging market and
developing economies, where the share of the population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations
above the least stringent WHO target falls by four-fifths to 7% in 2030.
Rapid reductions in air pollution in the NZE Scenario are achieved with feasible energy and
air quality policies and proven technologies. Access to clean cooking for all is essential to
reduce the use of inefficient biomass cookstoves and associated PM2.5 emissions, and there
is a lot of experience in devising successful clean cooking programmes (section 4.4.1). Since
the majority of transport emissions take place at street level, and often within densely
populated areas, strictly enforced emissions standards in road transport are central to
reduce nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions, particularly in cities. Achieving reductions in sulphur
dioxide (SO2) emissions depends to a large extent on fuel switching in the power sector and
on increasing energy efficiency in industry. The value of the resultant benefits is typically
many times higher than the costs of bringing about cleaner air.

Fuel security and trade

At the height of the energy crisis in 2022, record high natural gas prices were translating into
a daily flow of USD 500 million from the European Union to Russia. Over a year on from the
start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, energy flows from Russia to Europe have slowed to a
trickle and the contours of a new global oil and gas trade balance are coming into view. Russia
is redirecting its oil and, to a lesser extent its natural gas, to Asia and other non-European
markets. However, its role in global oil and gas trade is set to diminish as a result of the
long-term effects of sanctions, further reductions in exports to Europe, and difficulties in fully
offsetting the lost volume by redirecting exports to Asia.
Global oil and gas trade is set to become increasingly concentrated on flows between the
Middle East and Asia. In the STEPS, seaborne crude oil trade from the Middle East to Asia
rises from around 40% of total global trade today to around 50% by 2050. Asia is also the
final destination for three-quarters of incremental Middle East liquefied natural gas (LNG)
supply between 2022 and 2030 (Figure 4.8). In the APS, developing economies in Asia
continue to draw in oil and gas imports as they build their clean energy systems. The Middle
East-Asia trade route accounts for some 40% of all global oil and gas trade in 2030 and 45%
in 2050, up from 35% today. In the NZE Scenario, the share of this route increases further to
166

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

55% by 2050 even as the total volume of trade declines dramatically. The changing fuel trade
patterns in the APS and NZE Scenario have important implications for exporters and
importers alike and raise questions about how countries can work together to avoid supply
disruptions while achieving rapid transitions.

How does oil and natural gas trade change in the APS and NZE Scenario?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Oil and gas trade is relatively resilient in the APS and NZE Scenario to 2030: while oil and
natural gas demand fall by around 6% in the APS and 20% in the NZE Scenario by 2030, trade
expands by 2% in the APS and falls by only 12% in the NZE Scenario. In both scenarios, sharply
declining domestic demand in North America opens a large production surplus which drives
exports to 2030. Demand in emerging market and developing economies in Asia remains
relatively robust to 2030, meaning imports continue to rise, with falling domestic production
contributing to import demand in some countries. The value of trade nonetheless declines
sharply in the NZE Scenario as oil and natural gas prices drop (Figure 4.9).
There are many uncertainties about how global oil and gas trade might evolve under the
pressure of climate policy. In the APS, trade flows are determined by existing contractual
commitments, the pipeline of projects under development in the near term, the ability of
major producers to find export outlets in a world where oil and gas trade is shrinking, and
the cost of developing new supplies in the long run. In the NZE Scenario, trade flows are
dictated more by short-run costs and the production surpluses that form as falling domestic
demand frees up additional volumes for export.

The value of global oil and gas trade holds steady in the STEPS and to a lesser extent
in the APS; trade volumes are lower in the NZE Scenario, and less profitable too
Note: MER = market exchange rate; C & S America = Central and South America.

A number of exporters have set out why they think that they will continue to thrive even
during rapid transitions. Some say that their low production costs will allow them to
out-compete rival producers; others point to lower emissions intensities than those of rival
producers, or claim that they are a better option in terms of energy security. However, there
is no getting away from the point that any new resource developments in the NZE Scenario
would need to be matched by faster declines elsewhere to avoid oversupply or fossil fuel
lock-in, and that some producers could face large potential losses. The supply-side
assumptions in the NZE Scenario look to chart a middle ground between the various
trade-offs that exist, but other variants are possible.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the APS and the NZE Scenario, the reduction in oil and gas production results in a large
drop in government revenue for producer economies that in many cases rely on income from
state-owned oil and gas companies to fund fiscal spending. In the NZE Scenario, governments
in net exporting regions collect around USD 375 billion from the production of oil and gas in
2030, around 50% below the average take between 2017-2021. By 2050, this value falls to
around USD 90 billion (Figure 4.10). This reduction in state income underscores the
importance of developing economic diversification strategies, including by making full use of
the potential for clean energy.

Reductions in government revenue from oil and gas taxes affect exporters and importers

On the other side of the ledger, governments also earn revenue from oil and gas
consumption, for example in the form of excise taxes on gasoline at the pump. Globally,
these taxes exceed upstream taxes and royalties by a factor of two, suggesting that the shift
away from oil and gas might also pose major fiscal challenges for some net importers. In the
NZE Scenario, consumption-related taxes collected by net importing regions fall by
USD 750 billion between 2022 and 2030. The reduced tax take is, however, smaller as a share
of GDP in net importing regions than in producer economies heavily reliant on income from
hydrocarbon production and export. Moreover, the drop in oil and gas import bills in the APS
and NZE Scenario improves the overall trade balance for importing countries. In India, for
example, the oil import bill falls by USD 60 billion (40%) in the NZE Scenario in 2030 compared
with 2022. Fiscal balances can also be shored up by increasing tax revenue in other parts of
the energy sector, or by using levies collected from CO2 prices in place of the revenues
derived from the taxation of oil and gas consumption.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

How can countries and companies work together to navigate secure transitions?
Fragmented approaches by oil and gas producers and consumers could heighten energy
security risks and geopolitical tensions during net zero transitions. Any mismatch in the pace
of demand and supply reductions could cause very high or low prices, leading to turbulent
and volatile markets. Uncoordinated policy implementation could lead to overinvestment in
new oil and gas capacity or the premature retirement of existing infrastructure, and either
of these could undermine efforts to bring about secure energy transitions. A lack of
co-operation could also hamper the development and smooth functioning of the complex
values chains that are needed for large-scale trade in low-emissions fuels.
Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

169

Avoiding these pitfalls will require countries and companies to work together. There are
several ways for them to do this. Clear long-term plans on the part of major consuming
countries and sectors would help producers to make informed infrastructure and capital
investment decisions. If these consumers signal that they intend to place economic value on
products with lower emissions, producers will be incentivised to make capital investments
to lower the emissions intensity of their resources. Consumers and producers could in
addition explore joint investments to link clean energy supply with demand. Many producer
economies hold abundant renewable resources, as well as subsurface data and expertise for
potential CO2 storage: there is scope for countries to work together to boost investment in
renewables and to support technology demonstration and joint R&D projects to unlock CO2
storage potential. Regular bilateral and multilateral dialogues could further improve mutual
understanding of policy goals, help avoid potential disruptions and reduce the risks of
stranded capital.
The challenges of scaling up low-emissions fuels offer a clear example of the need for
enhanced co-operation across borders. Hydrogen trade is expected to involve almost all
regions (Figure 4.11). Long-term contracts, mutually agreed standards and certification
schemes are crucial to underpin the capital-intensive projects that will be needed.
Governments around the world have an important part to play in facilitating co‐ordinated
and timely investments, and this means in particular setting clear policy frameworks that are
compatible across borders.

Electricity security

Electricity is central to modern economies, accounting for around 20% of total final energy
consumption today. This increases in all scenarios, reaching 30% in the STEPS in 2050, 40%
in the APS and more than 50% in the NZE Scenario. Due to the higher efficiency of many
electrical processes, its share of useful energy provided is even larger, rising from 27% today
to about 45% in the STEPS in 2050, 50% in the APS and 65% in the NZE Scenario (Figure 4.12).

The share of electricity in useful energy demand increases
significantly in all scenarios, most of all in the NZE Scenario

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Electricity security means having a reliable and stable supply of electricity that can meet
demand at all times at an affordable price. Electricity supply has always needed to meet
demand continuously, down to the scale of seconds or less, to maintain system stability.
However, power systems are becoming more complex, and power system flexibility needs
are set to increase sharply in the future as a result of the rising share of variable wind and
solar photovoltaics (PV) and rising electricity demand.
In the light of these changes, maintaining electricity security in future power systems calls
for new tools and approaches. Power generators will need to be more agile, consumers will
need to be more connected and responsive, and grid infrastructure will need to be
strengthened and digitalised to support more dynamic flows of electricity and information.
Sufficient flexible capacity will have to be available to deal with variability across all
timescales, from the very short term to the very long term, across seasons and years. Power
systems will also need to adapt to both changing climate and weather patterns as well as
changing consumer behaviour (Box 4.1).
Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

How are increasing power system flexibility needs met in the future?
Most of the flexibility required across all timescales today is provided by dispatchable
thermal power plants and hydropower (including pumped storage). 3 In our three scenarios,
much of the additional short-term flexibility that is needed is provided by batteries and
demand response, especially after 2030. Thermal power plants and hydropower continue to
provide most seasonal flexibility, with demand response and curtailment of surplus
generation playing an increasingly important role towards the end of the outlook period.

Short-term needs increase significantly, mainly due to solar PV, with batteries and demand
response emerging as crucial suppliers of flexibility; seasonal needs rise less sharply
Notes: Flexibility needs are computed for 2030 and 2050 taking into account changes in electricity supply and
demand and weather variability over 30 historical years. Demand response includes the flexible operation of
electrolysers.

In the STEPS, short-term power system flexibility needs more than triple globally by 2050
relative to today. In the APS, they double by 2030 and rise 4.5-fold by 2050 (Figure 4.13).
Global needs for seasonal flexibility increase less sharply: they rise by nearly 20% to 2030 and
45% to 2050 in the APS. The fast-rising share of solar PV emerges as the key factor increasing
short-term flexibility needs: wind is less variable in the short term but can vary significantly
across weeks or seasons, and it becomes an important driver of seasonal flexibility needs as
its share increases in power systems across the world. Patterns of wind and solar output can
be complementary to variations in electricity demand, but their rising share tends to increase
overall system flexibility needs.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

3 Flexibility is defined as the ability of a power system to reliably and cost effectively manage the variability of

demand and supply. It ranges from ensuring the instantaneous stability of the power system to supporting
long-term security of supply.

172

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Rising flexibility needs and changes in the global power plant fleet – with the phase-out of
unabated coal in many regions – see the share of short-term flexibility provided by thermal
power plants drop from around 60% today to one-third by 2030 in the APS. Thermal power
plants, including unabated fossil fuel plants and low-emissions technologies (such as nuclear,
fossil fuels with carbon capture, utilisation and storage, bioenergy, hydrogen and ammonia),
remain important providers of seasonal flexibility through to 2040. It is only by 2050 that
their share in the flexibility mix drops to about 10%. The share of hydropower in the supply
of short-term flexibility falls as needs increase rapidly, but it remains an important source of
seasonal flexibility and is the main source of the seasonal balancing required after 2040.
Market designs and regulations need to ensure that the dispatch of pumped storage,
reservoir hydropower and other forms of long-term energy storage is aligned with the
long-term flexibility needs of the system.
Demand response is set to play an increasingly important part in the provision of short-term
flexibility as the contribution made by thermal power plants wanes. Expanding use of electric
heat pumps, air conditioners and EVs makes demand more variable, but it also creates
additional opportunities for demand-side response. Making the most of these opportunities
depends on the creation of a supportive regulatory environment which is underpinned by
adequate price signals, digital tools and smart controls. Effective demand-response policies
and instruments can also help consumers reduce their electricity bills (Box 4.3). In the APS,
demand response meets around one-third of short-term flexibility needs by 2030.

Batteries are emerging as a crucial means of providing short-term flexibility alongside
demand-response measures. Utility-scale battery storage capacity increases nearly 85-fold
in the STEPS, rising to more than 2 terawatts (TW) by 2050. In the APS it increases to just
over 3 TW by 2050 and provides roughly one-third of the short-term flexibility needed in
2050. Batteries are a good match for the daily cycle of solar PV-based electricity generation
in particular. On a typical day in India in 2050, for example, batteries could charge using
excess solar generation during the daytime and discharge at night, reducing curtailment and
the need to cycle thermal power plants over the course of a day (Figure 4.14).
There are also other options for the provision of both short-term and seasonal flexibility.
Low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia can be used in thermal power plants to provide
backup capacity, acting in effect as seasonal storage of renewable electricity. Grid-connected
electrolysers can offer significant amounts of both short-term and seasonal flexible capacity:
electrolysers provide roughly a quarter of the seasonal flexibility needed in 2050 in the APS.
In systems with high shares of variable renewables, it may also be economical to curtail some
of the surplus wind or solar PV generation to provide additional flexibility if other sources of
flexibility are unavailable or more costly to dispatch.

Changing patterns of consumption as electricity use increases have a significant impact on
peak electricity demand over the year (Figure 4.15). In the STEPS, peak demand increases by
174

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

37% in the United States and 65% in the European Union to 2050. The increase is more
pronounced in countries with significant space cooling needs as more people start to use air
conditioners. In India, for example, there is a fourfold increase in peak electricity demand by
2050 as a result of expanding electrification, increased use of air conditioners and EV
charging.
Energy efficiency has a vital part to play in mitigating the increase in peak demand and
reducing stress on electricity networks. The contribution of air conditioning to peak demand,
for example, is cut by half in India and by two-thirds in the United States in the APS compared
with the STEPS in 2050 by more stringent minimum energy performance standards and more
efficient building designs. Since a large share of the increase in peak demand is driven by
end-uses with significant flexibility potential, such as EVs, air conditioners and heat pumps,
increases in uncontrolled peak demand can be also mitigated by demand-side response
measures.

Seasonal flexibility needs can vary significantly, leading to large differences in

Note: A weather year is a set of weather parameters such as temperature, solar radiation, wind speed
and precipitation compiled from historical records to create curves of hourly loads and renewables
output.

To examine how seasonal flexibility needs could vary across years, we analysed how the
power system in Europe would need to evolve in the APS to 2030 and 2050 to be able to
handle 30 different possible weather years (Figure 4.16). As the share of wind and solar
PV in power generation increases at the expense of fossil fuels the frequency and

duration of low wind periods coinciding with cloudy skies and low temperatures is a
significant contributor to seasonal flexibility needs. This has a substantial impact on the
operation of the dispatchable power fleet, notably natural gas-fired plants and
hydropower, which must absorb most of the variation between seasons and years.
In 2030, the most extreme conditions in a weather year could induce a 40% upward or
downward variation in the annual use of gas-fired power plants in Europe compared with
an average weather year. The resultant uncertainty about revenues for these plants and
about their profitability could act as a drag on investment in them, despite their essential
role as providers of system adequacy and flexibility. Adapting market designs and
establishing instruments to ensure sufficient investment is essential for security of
supply.
Short-term flexibility needs more than quadruple by 2050 in the APS compared with the
current level, mainly because of the integration of variable renewables. For 2030,
differences between weather years have less impact on the magnitude of these
requirements: they vary by around 5% upwards or downwards compared with an average
weather year.

Will grids be ready in time to enable power sector transitions?
There are approximately 80 million kilometres (km) of electricity networks worldwide today.
Significant grid enhancements are needed in all scenarios to meet the increasing pace of
electrification and accelerated deployment of renewable energy sources. 4 New transmission
lines are necessary to connect large-scale wind and solar PV projects to demand centres,
sometimes over long distances, and offshore substations and cabling are needed to connect
the new and planned offshore wind farms to the mainland. Distribution lines also need to be
expanded to accommodate increasing electricity demand and the rapid growth of distributed
solar PV capacity. Further links within and between countries and regions are needed to
reduce the requirement for flexibility from alternative sources and to facilitate the
integration of further potential flexibility providers. Total grid line lengths increase by about
18% from 2022 to 2030 in the STEPS and APS, and by 20% in the NZE Scenario.
In addition to the extension of power lines, investment in digitalisation, smart systems and
advanced high power semiconductor technologies is needed to improve the control and
stability of electricity flows. Smart grids and grid components such as flexible alternating
current (AC) transmission systems make it easier to accommodate the increasing share of
variable generation from solar PV and wind. They also present an opportunity to improve
grid management and to make new investment in grids more targeted and efficient.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

This means that a major increase in investment is required to ensure grid reliability, support
clean energy transitions and achieve universal electricity access (Box 4.2). Some new
4 See Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions (IEA, 2023b) for a comprehensive analysis on the role of
grids.

176

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

investment is already planned: the pipeline of announced high voltage direct current (HVDC)
projects is set to lead to an increase in the length of HVDC lines by around 45% to 2030.
Obtaining the necessary new investment and building the new grid infrastructure required
in the APS and the NZE Scenario is challenging but feasible. However, early action and holistic
planning are needed to avoid delays in connecting sources of renewable energy, given that
grid projects can take more than a decade and typically have much longer timelines than
renewable energy projects, and measures to expedite permitting processes for new grid
infrastructure would help a great deal.
Box 4.2 ⊳

Scaling up investment in electricity networks

There is a gap between current grid spending trends and the investment required to
reach climate goals, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Annual
investment in grids worldwide is set to reach USD 330 billion in 2023. This climbs to
USD 565 billion by 2030 in the STEPS, but it needs to rise further to around
USD 620 billion in the APS and USD 680 billion in the NZE Scenario. Based on recent
trends, spending in 2030 in emerging market and developing economies would be less
than half the investment needs of the APS (USD 335 billion), while the gap in advanced
economies is far smaller (Figure 4.17).

However, the biggest challenges are in emerging market and developing economies,
where responsibility for investment often lies with cash-constrained and heavily
indebted public utilities. For example, the South Africa utility, Eskom, has around
USD 20 billion of guaranteed debt at risk of default, raising South Africa’s risk premium
and borrowing costs.
Concessional funding from international development finance institutions (DFIs) offers
one way out of this impasse. This needs to be accompanied by reforms that aim to create
healthier utilities and business models. It is not easy to bring about such reforms: many
developing country utilities have a majority of low income customers which cannot afford
higher electricity prices, and innovative approaches will be needed. In the case of Eskom,
the National Treasury in South Africa has developed a debt-relief arrangement of around
USD 15 billion as an interest-free sub-ordinated loan, which will improve the debt-equity
ratio and balance sheet.
Despite a heavy reliance on public funding when developing concessional finance and
reform packages, there is scope for DFIs and governments to develop business models
that allow the private sector to participate in grid development and strengthening. For
example, independent power transmission (IPT) projects are designed to offer rights over
a specific transmission line through a tendering process. Governments and state-owned
enterprises can be involved in the ownership and operational risk of the project,
depending on the type of IPT contract. This model has recently been introduced in Africa,
and similar arrangements have previously been implemented successfully in Brazil and
Colombia.

4.3.3

Clean energy supply chains and critical minerals

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The development of clean energy technology supply chains has made impressive progress
since 2015, boosted recently by stimulus spending related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the
response from governments to the global energy crisis, and growing commercial and
geopolitical competition. Progress has been particularly fast in the manufacturing segment,
notably for solar panels and batteries, where new facilities are benefiting from
standardisation and short lead times. The pipeline of announced manufacturing projects is
expanding rapidly. If all announced solar PV module manufacturing projects come to fruition,
their combined output globally, together with that from the increased utilisation of existing
capacity, would exceed the deployment needs of the NZE Scenario in 2030; EV and grid
storage battery needs for 2030 would almost be met on the same basis (Figure 4.18).
The expected pace of growth in critical mineral supplies does not match that of clean energy
technology manufacturing capacity additions, although an increasing number of new
projects have recently been announced. The overall pace of transition is usually determined
by the slowest-moving component, and that makes it important to strengthen efforts to scale
up investment in critical mineral supplies.

Progress on the development of clean energy supply chains has been uneven
Notes: Announced pipeline includes both committed and preliminary projects. For critical minerals, the
NZE Scenario deployment needs refer to the primary supply requirements (total demand less secondary
supply).

A high degree of supply chain concentration remains a major concern for both clean energy
technology manufacturing and critical minerals as it can make the entire supply chain
vulnerable to individual country policy choices, company decisions, natural disasters or
technical failures.

How can we accelerate the diversification of clean energy manufacturing?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Clean energy technology supply chains today are more geographically concentrated than
fossil fuel supply chains. China has an outsized presence in most of them, and they are
generally dominated by a small number of countries. For key clean energy technologies such
as solar PV, batteries and electrolysers, for example, the largest three regions account for
80-90% of global capacity, with the largest single producer accounting for up to 80%
(IEA, 2023c).
Many countries are competing to secure their place in the new global energy economy. The
pipeline of announced projects for clean energy technology manufacturing shows some
positive signs in terms of diversification, but the situation varies by technology (Figure 4.19).
In the case of batteries, electrolysers and heat pumps, many projects are now being
developed, notably in the United States and Europe, which – if they all come to fruition –
would lead to a moderate decrease in China’s share of the market. However, China is set to
maintain a dominant position for solar PV and wind this decade.

Announced projects – if all realised – will alter the global distribution

2023 refers to installed capacity as of Q1 2023; figure for 2030 refers to production in 2030 from all existing

To accelerate progress on diversifying supply chains, countries need both to develop
dedicated industrial strategies and to strengthen international co-operation. It is clearly
crucial in this context to identify and monitor the major clean energy technology supply chain
risks that could delay or disrupt deployment, given that supply chains are only as strong as
their weakest link. Building strategic partnerships is also crucial. It is not realistic or efficient
for most countries to seek to compete in all parts of all supply chains. Identifying relative
strengths and seeking complementary partnerships should be at the heart of the
development of industrial strategies for clean technology manufacturing. More attention
also needs to be paid to opportunities to support in-country energy transitions and
socioeconomic development in emerging market and developing economies.

Are we on track to ensure diversified and resilient critical mineral supplies?
Critical minerals, which are essential for a range of clean energy technologies, have risen up
the policy agenda in recent years in the wake of increasing demand, volatile price
movements, supply chain bottlenecks and geopolitical concerns. Demand for critical
minerals for clean energy technologies is set to increase rapidly in all of the scenarios. In the
APS, demand almost triples by 2030. In the NZE Scenario, a faster deployment of clean energy
technologies implies an almost fourfold increase in demand for critical minerals in 2030,
compared with today. EVs and battery storage are the main drivers of demand growth, but
there are also major contributions from low-emissions power generation and electricity
180

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

networks. As demand for clean energy applications expands faster than other uses, the share
of clean energy in total demand for key minerals rises considerably: in the APS, it reaches
over 80% for lithium, nearly 60% for cobalt and around 40% for nickel and copper in 2030.
Meeting these demands requires a significant ramp-up in mining and refining activities,
especially in geographically diversified regions. Inadequate mineral supplies could make
energy transitions slower or more expensive, and the reversal in 2021 and 2022 of a
decade-long reduction in clean energy technology costs served as a reminder that steady
increases in supply and decreases in price cannot be taken for granted. Concerns about
security of supply have already prompted many countries to introduce a range of policies
designed to secure or promote mineral supplies. Many downstream companies such as EV
manufacturers and battery cell makers are also becoming involved in the critical mineral
value chain through strategic investments in mining and refining operations. Long-term
off-take agreements have become the norm, and there has been a notable increase in direct
investment activities since 2021 (Table 4.1).

There are some positive signs in terms of new supply. Investment in critical minerals
development rose by 30% in 2022, and this followed a 20% increase in 2021. Exploration
spending also rose by 20% in 2022, driven by record growth in lithium exploration, especially
in Canada and Australia. Critical minerals start-ups raised a record USD 1.6 billion in 2022, a
160% increase from 2021, despite headwinds in the wider venture capital sector (IEA, 2023c).
Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

These increases in capital spending indicate that supply is catching up with national clean
energy ambitions as reflected in the APS. Meeting the requirements in the NZE Scenario
depends however on further projects coming through. Moreover, the adequacy of planned
future supply is far from assured. Delays and cost overruns have occurred regularly in the
past. The supply of battery-grade and high-quality products may still be constrained even
when an overall balance of supply and demand is achieved. And new mining plays often come
with higher production costs, which could push up marginal costs and prices.
While some progress has been made in increasing supplies, limited progress has been made
in diversifying supply sources; the situation has even worsened in some cases. The share of
the top-three producers in 2022 is either unchanged or has increased from 2019 levels,
especially for nickel and cobalt. Our analysis of project pipelines indicates that concentration
levels in 2030 are set to remain high, especially for refining operations, which is where the
current geographical concentration is strongest. Many planned projects are being developed
in the current dominant regions, with China holding half of planned lithium chemical plants
and Indonesia representing nearly 90% of planned nickel refining facilities (Figure 4.20). This
heightens consumer exposure to various geopolitical events as highlighted by the export
curbs on gallium and germanium from China in August 2023. From Africa to Latin America
and the Caribbean, many resource-holding nations are seeking positions further up the value
chain while many consuming countries want to diversify their source of refined metal
supplies. However, the world has not yet successfully connected the dots to build diversified
midstream supply chains.

Market balances do not just depend on supply. There is significant scope for actions on the
demand side to ease potential strains, via recycling, technology development, smaller EVs
and so on. For example, the average battery size for passenger electric cars has been on a
rising trend in nearly every major market as the desire for larger vehicles as in conventional
car markets is replicated in the EV market. If this trend persists, it would push up material
demand for batteries by 15% in 2030 in the NZE Scenario. On the other hand, the faster
adoption of technologies such as sodium-ion batteries or lithium-ion phosphate chemistries
could reduce material demand by 7% in 2030.
Progress towards improving sustainable and responsible practices has been mixed. Our
assessment of the environmental and social performance of major companies shows that
companies are making headway on social indicators such as community investment, worker
safety and gender balance. However, environmental indicators such as GHG emissions, waste
and water use are not improving at the same rate, and there are few signs that end-users are
prioritising cleaner production pathways in their sourcing and investment decisions,
although some downstream companies have started to give preference to minerals with
lower climate impact.
Every country’s strategy on critical minerals will inevitably reflect its specific circumstances,
but key components are likely to include investment, innovation, recycling and rigorous
sustainability standards. More co-operative approaches between producers and consumers
could help to build more diverse supply chains and ensure fair access to raw materials. More
support for further technological innovation and recycling, which has already shown its
ability to relieve some of the pressure on primary supplies, could bring further
improvements.

Energy access

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The number of people without access to electricity worldwide has decreased by more than
45% since 2010, primarily driven by progress in developing Asia, but 760 million people still
lack access today (Figure 4.21). The situation is most pressing in countries in sub-Saharan
Africa, where around 80% of people without access to electricity live. While there have been
some recent improvements in access in sub-Saharan Africa, these have not kept pace with
population growth, with the result that there has been a 2.5% increase in the number of
people without access since 2010. In the STEPS, current policies reduce the global number of
people without access to electricity by around 125 million in 2030, although population
growth means there are still around 650 million people without access in 2030. In the APS,
the number of people without access to electricity falls to 270 million by 2030, and the
number of people without access in countries in sub-Saharan Africa is cut by two-thirds.
In the NZE Scenario, universal access to electricity is achieved by 2030.

Number of people without access to clean cooking declines by just over 15%
to 2030 in the STEPS and progress on access to electricity is also slow
Note: Sub-Saharan Africa excludes South Africa.

Almost 2.3 billion people today use traditional biomass, coal or kerosene for their cooking
needs; most of these are in countries in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. In the STEPS,
the number of people without access to clean cooking facilities falls by just over 15% to 2030.
If all national clean cooking targets were achieved by 2030, as assumed in the APS, the
number of people without access would fall by two-thirds, but around 735 million people
would remain without access. In the NZE Scenario, universal access to clean cooking is
achieved by 2030, as it is for access to electricity.

Are off-grid solutions the key driver behind recent progress in access to electricity?
Over the years, solar home systems (SHS) have demonstrated their viability as a reliable
electricity source for households, particularly in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa that do not
have access to reliable grid connections. Since 2015, annual sales of SHS with capacities
above 11 Watt-peak (Wp) have increased more than sevenfold in the sub-Saharan region
(Figure 4.22). Such systems can provide sufficient electricity for a bundle of basic energy
services, including lighting, phone charging and a radio, though only systems above 50 Wp
are considered as providing essential access. 5

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Today, more than 45 million people use SHS above 11 Wp in sub-Saharan Africa, accounting
for just under 10% of the population with access to electricity. In 2022, SHS contributed to
more than half of the increase in access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa (IEA, 2023d).
5 An essential bundle includes four light bulbs for four hours per day, a fan for three hours per day, and a
television for two hours per day, which equates to roughly 500 kilowatt-hours per household per year.

184

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Off-grid connections play a central role in bringing about universal access by the end of this
decade in the NZE Scenario. Over time households in all but the most remote settlements
will gradually transition from off-grid to grid connections by 2050.

solar home systems are equipped with a solar panel rated above 50 Wp. Sub-Saharan Africa excludes
South Africa.
Source: IEA analysis based on sales databases of the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA, 2023).

Despite recent rising equipment costs for solar home systems, sales remained relatively
stable throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and they are still typically more affordable than
grid connections in many sub-Saharan countries. In 2022, sales of SHS surged by around 50%
in sub-Saharan Africa and were double the level achieved in 2018. Pay-as-you-go systems
that remove the upfront cost barrier play an essential role where affordability is the main
concern and access to loans remains low. These systems currently account for nearly 95% of
sales of SHS in the region among key distributers. However, pay-as-you-go systems rely on
mobile phone services, posing significant challenges in regions with weak network coverage
and reliability.

How can universal access to clean cooking be achieved by 2030?
The number of people without access to clean cooking globally has fallen by around
650 million people since 2010, but the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy crisis have
caused slow-downs and setbacks. In sub-Saharan Africa countries, the population without

access has risen continuously, despite efforts by countries such as Kenya and Nigeria.
Achieving universal access to clean cooking, as in the NZE Scenario, requires actions to be
taken that enable nearly 2.4 billion additional people to use modern cooking fuels by the end
of this decade.
Developments in Asia demonstrate that progress can be achieved quickly. In India, for
example, more than 450 million people gained access over just ten years as a result of
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) focussed policies. However, limitations in terms of import,
storage and transport infrastructure for LPG and lower population densities in sub-Saharan
Africa in the near term imply that improved biomass cookstoves need to play a much larger
transitional role before rural households move to modern cooking fuels (IEA, 2023e).

Note: Impacts on annual investment, energy demand and GHG emissions refer to the buildings sector.

Universal access to clean cooking could be achieved with annual investment of around
USD 8 billion between today and 2030 along with a set of initiatives to incentivise the
adoption of clean fuels and stoves. This would yield immense benefits in terms of improved
health, improved gender equity and increased productivity (Figure 4.23). For example, the
number of premature deaths due to indoor air pollution would be cut by over 70%, and GHG
emissions associated with cooking would be cut by half, as people would no longer rely on
the extremely inefficient use of traditional biomass. A further benefit would be to free up
the substantial amount of time currently spent on collecting wood for use as fuel each day,
a burden mainly carried by women.

4.4.2

Energy affordability

Today, households in advanced economies on average consume nearly three-times more
modern energy than households in emerging market and developing economies. 6 This
reflects major income-driven differences in appliance ownership, size of living space and
levels of comfort. For example, heating and cooling needs are largely met in advanced
economies, whereas the majority of people with space cooling needs in emerging market
and developing economies cannot afford adequate means to cool their residences
(IEA, 2022). Transport fuel use is even more unequal, as car ownership per capita is five-times
lower in emerging market and developing economies than in advanced economies. These
differences in energy consumption decrease in all of our scenarios as households in emerging
market and developing economies become wealthier and consume more energy services.
In advanced economies, household energy bills fall by nearly 20% in the STEPS to 2030 as a
result of energy efficiency gains and lower wholesale energy prices. In the NZE Scenario, bills
fall by close to 40% to 2030 mainly thanks to higher energy efficiency gains from home
retrofits, heat pumps, more efficient appliances and faster uptake of EVs. While these all
require additional upfront capital costs, on average they generate larger savings over their
lifetimes (Figure 4.24).

In emerging market and developing economies, energy bills are higher in the NZE Scenario
than in the STEPS by 2030, partly because of higher energy service demands and partly
because of expansion and strengthening of carbon pricing schemes and the phasing out of
inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. These policy changes need to be carefully designed to limit
impacts on household budgets and to sustain support for the clean energy transition
(Box 4.3). Some of the revenues from carbon pricing, for example, could be used to help
lower income consumers meet the upfront capital costs of clean energy appliances. Phasing
out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies lowers the burden on government budgets: some of the
savings could be used to provide more effective and better targeted support for the energy
costs of low income households through direct payment schemes or other means.
Box 4.3 ⊳

Demand-side response as a tool to cut energy bills

Recent pilot programmes in the United Kingdom and Australia demonstrate that
demand-response policies and instruments can help consumers significantly reduce their
electricity bills. Responsive technologies and electricity tariffs allow consumers to
respond to market signals by increasing electricity consumption when prices are low and
reducing it during peak hours, for example by charging an EV overnight when electricity
demand and prices are lower. Demand-side response can also help limit curtailment of
solar PV and wind at times of higher generation.

Demand-side response measures can help consumers cut energy bills by up to
nearly 20% by 2050 in particular by shifting EV charging and water heating patterns
Notes: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Demand response refers to the ability of a
consumer to shift consumption in time with no or limited impact on comfort. Estimates of the potential
of demand-response measures account for technology and acceptability limitations.

188

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

In the NZE Scenario, demand-response measures reduce the average household
electricity bill in advanced economies by 3-6% in 2030 and 7-12% in 2050 (Figure 4.25).
In emerging market and developing economies, bills could be reduced by up to 20% by
2050. The key in many countries is the rising use of solar PV, which incentivises a shift of
energy consumption to daylight hours where possible. Major end-uses such as EV
charging and water heating provide the largest contributions. Additional savings come
from operating appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators flexibly in line with
price signals.

Did short-term affordability measures help tame energy price spikes in 2022?
In 2022, household budgets were squeezed around the world as a result of soaring energy
prices. Wholesale prices for electricity, natural gas and other fuels were already increasing in
2021, but they rose further after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Government interventions
helped limit the impact on retail energy prices through measures such as grants and vouchers
for consumers, compensation for utilities that kept prices down, and exemptions from
energy taxes and charges (IEA, 2023f). The majority of short-term affordability spending was
in Europe and other advanced economies. Wholesale energy prices have now passed their
peak, but retail prices are falling more slowly and many support measures remain in place.
While support measures had an important part to play in avoiding unsustainable burdens on
households during a period of crisis, they are a major burden for governments and risk
diminishing the incentive to use energy efficiently or to switch to cleaner fuels.

Energy prices increased sharply in 2022, though support measures,

The global average share of household income spent on household energy bills increased
marginally in 2022. In Japan and South Africa and some countries in Europe, expenditure
shares increased by one percentage point on average, with much larger increases for lower
income households (Figure 4.26). Energy expenditure would have been even higher in some
cases had residential demand not decreased. Government-led campaigns in a number of
countries in Europe, encouraged consumers to adjust their thermostats, though some
vulnerable households had no choice in any case but to cut back on heating their homes in
view of skyrocketing energy prices.
The share of income directly spent on home energy bills remained flat or even declined in
countries where there was substantial government support to keep retail bills down or a
relatively low level of dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation, although
household budgets were still squeezed by higher transport fuel costs. In most emerging
market and developing economies, higher prices for transport fuel imposed a major burden
on households, as did rising food prices. Around 60% of the financial support provided by
governments in emerging market and developing economies targeted high transport fuel
prices.

Are clean energy technologies affordable for all consumers?
Consumers play a key role in shaping the clean energy transition when they choose to buy
clean energy technologies in order to benefit from lower energy bills. However, it remains
challenging for many consumers to find the money for important clean energy goods such as
EVs and heat pumps or to fund energy efficiency retrofits in buildings. In the United States,
for example, high income households are ten-times more likely to own an EV than the lowest
income groups, and they also tend to have more solar panels and use more efficient
appliances and lighting technologies (Davis, 2023). One way of making clean energy
technologies more affordable is to use general energy taxation to encourage cleaner and
more efficient consumer choices, aiming incentives at lower income households in particular.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Some clean energy technologies are already competitive with fossil fuel alternatives, or are
very nearly so. In the United States, for example, air source heat pumps often do not cost
significantly more than gas boilers and can provide substantial savings over their lifetime. In
some markets, such as Sweden, they can even cost less than fossil fuel-powered alternatives.
Heat pump ownership is still typically less among low income households where upfront cost
barriers persist, which is the case in many parts of Europe. EVs, in particular smaller models
and two-wheelers, are often an exception: in some countries, such as China, they are already
available at prices that are comparable with (and sometimes lower than) those of gasoline
or diesel fuel options.
Energy efficiency retrofits in buildings require substantial upfront investment. This can be
equivalent to up to nine months of income for poorer households, and can represent a
barrier for most other households as well. As a result, few such retrofits take place, even
though they bring down energy bills for decades (Figure 4.27). Well-designed financial
incentives remain crucial to scale up retrofits with high upfront costs across all income
groups: they can be gradually phased out for well-off households as purchase costs decrease.

Energy employment

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Nearly 67 million people worked in the energy industry worldwide in 2022, with clean energy
– including low-emissions fuels, low-emissions power generation, power grids and storage,
energy efficiency, and EVs and batteries – accounting for over half of all jobs. End-use sectors,
including energy efficiency and vehicle manufacturing, have the largest employment base
(24 million workers), followed by the supply of fuels and critical minerals (22 million workers)
and the power sector (20 million workers). Most energy workers are in the Asia Pacific
region, with China alone accounting for almost 30% of all energy jobs. North America, Europe
and India account for just over 10% each.
In all the scenarios, job creation associated with clean energy technologies comfortably
outweighs job losses in fossil fuel and related industries through to 2030. In the NZE Scenario,
17 million additional jobs are generated in total (Figure 4.28). In some cases, jobs lost in one
sector could transfer to others. For example, many workers involved in the assembly of
internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles could switch to assembling EVs. In other cases,
however, new jobs created such as renewable power generation require training, may not
pay the same wages and may not be in the same places as the jobs lost in fossil fuel industries
such as coal mining. In such cases, targeted action by national and local governments,

Are labour shortages a barrier to meeting transition goals?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The success of the energy transition will depend not only on technological innovation and
the mobilisation of capital but also on the millions of workers that will build and operate
clean energy installations. The availability of properly skilled labour for the jobs that are being
created is already emerging as a potential bottleneck to achieve transition goals in the near
to medium term.
Construction represents the largest segment of clean energy employment today and by far
the most significant source of job growth through 2030 in the APS and NZE Scenario.
However, construction worker shortages are already threatening the pace of clean energy
installations in dozens of markets worldwide. It is also proving difficult to recruit adequate
numbers of tradespeople such as electricians, plumbers and welders, millions of which will
be needed for jobs across the entire energy value chain. The manufacturing sector, another
192

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

substantial area of energy employment growth, is also encountering staffing issues as labour
demand increases. Even in manufacturing-intensive economies such as China, factors
including shrinking working populations and a preference for white-collar jobs are preventing
the manufacturing workforce from increasing quickly enough to meet future demand.
A variety of measures will be necessary to attract the workers that are needed for the future.
Pay and working conditions will clearly be important, as will the provision of relevant
education and training. In the STEPS, more than one-third of clean energy jobs created
through 2030 are high-skilled and will generally require tertiary education, such as university
degrees, while an even higher share of medium-skilled jobs will necessitate vocational or
apprentice style training. Vocational education in construction, engineering and other critical
areas has so far not managed to keep pace with the rising demand for this type and degree
of skills (Figure 4.29). Industry and educational institutions need to collaborate to fill this gap
and prepare the next generation of workers.

Behavioural change

Energy demand depends on the behavioural choices of billions of consumers worldwide.
Behavioural changes are actions that energy consumers take to reduce wasteful or
unnecessary energy consumption and so help cut energy intensity. Many of these changes
Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

193

take place as part and parcel of daily life, and involve using energy differently or using less of
it. These changes depend in part on individual choices and evolving socio-cultural norms.
However, it is systemic transformations brought about by targeted and well-designed policy
interventions that count most in changing consumer behaviour, and these often depend on
the availability of infrastructure of one kind or another.
Technical options to reduce energy use are accelerated in the APS and maximised in the
NZE Scenario, but the pace of stock turnover imposes inherent constraints on what can be
achieved by 2035. The behavioural changes in the APS reflect those incorporated into net
zero emissions pledges. These are mainly concerned with road transport, for example
including traffic reduction measures in cities. The behavioural changes in the NZE Scenario
are more wide ranging and systemic in nature, and include boosting shared mobility,
reducing speed limits, discouraging sport utility vehicle ownership and use, adjusting heating
and cooling temperatures in buildings, and switching from planes to trains or
videoconferencing where possible (Figure 4.30). The NZE Scenario also integrates financial
incentives and disincentives, for example including frequent flyer levies to reduce aviation
demand in an equitable way.

energy consumption, as evidenced by the finding that the top 10% of emitters in the global
population were responsible for almost half of all energy-related CO2 emissions in 2021
(IEA, 2023g). Behavioural changes in the NZE Scenario help to bring about a more equitable
and just energy transition. In 2035, on a per capita basis, the energy savings from behavioural
changes in aviation are about nine-times bigger in advanced economies than in emerging
market and developing economies; in road transport and buildings they are about five-times
larger.
The role of behavioural changes in the energy transition shifts over time (Figure 4.31). In the
near term, behavioural changes are particularly important to address the decarbonisation
challenges of locked-in emissions from carbon-intensive assets, such as ICE cars on the road
or fossil fuel boilers in homes. In 2030, they cut oil demand by 6% and natural gas demand
by 3% in the NZE Scenario compared with the STEPS. In the longer term, their impact on
emissions fades as the energy system becomes increasingly clean, but they still significantly
reduce energy use in 2050.

Are there best practice policies emerging to trigger behavioural change?
The energy crisis of 2022 prompted behavioural interventions by European governments
seeking to reduce supply risk. For example, countries including Denmark, Germany, Ireland
and Sweden launched national energy savings campaigns. The Sobriété Energétique (Energy
Sobriety) programme in France introduced a host of behavioural measures, for example,
reducing speed limits to 110 kilometres per hour on highways for government employees,
stipulating that lighting for businesses, offices and billboards must be switched off at night,
increasing cash incentives for remote working, and promoting carpooling.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Globally, behavioural policies are being employed by governments at an accelerating rate. In
the Group of 20 (G20), for example, the number of policies supporting behavioural changes
has more than doubled since 2021. Around 50 countries have included behavioural measures
to some extent in their NDCs or strategies to reach net zero emissions targets. For example,
the NDCs of Bangladesh and Türkiye include targets for modal shifts from road transport to
rail, while Colombia and Austria have set percentage increase targets for bicycle use. There
is increasing awareness of the potential for policy interventions to encourage and facilitate
behavioural change, alongside a recognition that clean energy transitions cannot happen
without the consent, active support and engagement of people.
In terms of their design, scope and impact, the behavioural changes in the NZE Scenario are
similar to many of the recent measures enacted by governments and sub-national
jurisdictions (Table 4.2). For example, private car activity declines by up to 15% in the
NZE Scenario by 2030 – a reduction similar in size to the one seen in London since the
introduction of an Ultra-Low-Emissions Zone in 2019 (18%) – and far lower than the drop
seen in Paris (45%) stemming from measures such as the addition of more than 300 km of
bicycle lanes and limits on the road space available for private cars.

4.5

Investment and finance needs

Energy investment is crucially important in each of our scenarios. In the STEPS, global energy
investment rises to USD 3.2 trillion in 2030, nearly 15% higher than estimated levels for 2023
(USD 2.8 trillion). Clean energy investment accounts for all the increase, with fossil fuel
investment falling slightly to USD 1.1 trillion. The total increase in investment is larger in the
APS (a 40% increase from 2022 levels by 2030) and NZE Scenario (a 80% increase from 2022
levels by 2030) given the need for more upfront capital for clean energy investment. Clean
energy accounts for USD 3.1 trillion of the USD 3.8 trillion invested in 2030 in the APS, and
USD 4.2 trillion of the USD 4.7 trillion invested in 2030 in the NZE Scenario (Figure 4.32).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Advanced economies more than double their clean energy investment by 2030 in the
NZE Scenario, while investment in China nearly doubles from its current level. The rise in
other emerging market and developing economies is much larger, with clean energy
investment rising in the NZE Scenario in 2030 to five-times today’s level. The scale of the
increase that is required in part reflects the difficulties that the countries in question have so
far found in ramping up clean energy investment. Scaling up clean energy investment in these
economies is a key challenge for orderly and just transitions and requires actions in three
inter-related areas:


A clearly-articulated and ambitious vision for clean energy, underpinned by effective
changes to policy and regulatory regimes.



Investment in human and institutional capacity and strong energy sector governance to
help generate a pipeline of well-structured programmes and projects.



Enhanced international support, including significantly more concessional finance and
technical assistance to mitigate country and project risks and to act as an anchor for new
instruments and platforms capable of attracting domestic and international investment
capital at scale. Bilateral and multilateral development banks have an important role to
play in advising on policy frameworks, financing and helping to develop early-stage
projects, and using concessional capital to mobilise larger multiples of private capital.

Are we investing enough in energy efficiency and end-use decarbonisation?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Demand-side investment is sometimes overlooked in discussions on energy transitions, but
it has a crucial part to play. It includes in particular investment to boost energy efficiency and
encourage behavioural change; to accelerate expanded electrification of mobility and heat
via EVs and heat pumps; and to increase the direct use of renewables for heating, cooling
and industrial processes, for example by using solar water heaters and by deploying thermal
energy storage to electrify industrial heat processes.
Current trends in these areas are mixed. Investment in electrified end-use applications is
rising rapidly, reflecting the burgeoning sales of EVs and heat pumps, mainly in Europe, China
and North America. Investment in efficiency received something of a boost from stimulus
packages related to the Covid-19 pandemic, and also from exceptionally high energy prices
in 2022 that provided signals to consumers to adopt more energy efficient solutions. But
there are signs that efficiency investment is flattening in 2023 amid a slowdown in
construction activity, higher borrowing costs and strains on household and corporate
budgets.
198

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

There is a large gap between current trends and the investment required to get on track for
the NZE Scenario. The NZE Scenario sees a doubling of investment in energy efficiency
measures by 2030 and a broad-based rise in end-use electrification (Figure 4.33). This not
only helps to reduce emissions but improves health outcomes, insulates consumers from fuel
price volatility, and improves energy security and the balance of payments for countries
dependent on imported fuels. Many of the largest gaps in efficiency investment are in
emerging market and developing economies, reflecting the difficulty that many households
and businesses face in managing upfront costs, and the relative weakness of policy
frameworks and enforcement in many countries.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Energy efficiency in the buildings sector stands out as in particular need of higher investment:
in the NZE Scenario, it requires a sixfold increase in spending by 2030 in China and a 23-fold
rise in other emerging market and developing economies. The urban population is increasing
rapidly in most developing economies, and ensuring that new buildings meet high
performance standards for heating and cooling presents a huge opportunity to minimise
future strains on energy supply and to limit emissions. However, relatively few developing
economies other than India have so far put energy efficiency building codes in place.
When it comes to electrification of energy end-uses, more investment is needed in all regions
in the NZE Scenario. In recent years, more than half of global EV sales took place in China,
but it will still need to double investment by 2030 (USD 150 billion) and advanced economies
will need to increase spending by a factor of seven to meet investment levels in the
Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

199

NZE Scenario (USD 370 billion). Emerging market and developing economies other than
China will need to increase investment to USD 110 billion, which is more than 50-times
higher than current levels. Electric two/three-wheelers are widely available in many
developing economies, as are electric buses, but in most cases EV deployment levels are only
just starting to rise: the share of electric cars in total sales was 3% in Thailand in 2022, and
1.5% in India and Indonesia (IEA, 2023h).
Rising debt levels and higher borrowing costs mean that few developing economies will have
the budgetary space to replicate the EV purchase subsidies that have driven the EV boom in
China and advanced economies, and they will need international support to increase the
uptake of EVs. The concessional funding needed for emerging market and developing
economies other than China to support transport energy efficiency and decarbonisation in
the NZE Scenario is estimated at around USD 10 billion annually by the early 2030s. This could
focus initially on reducing the cost of electric two/three-wheelers, e-buses and taxi fleets to
make them more affordable with provision of concessional finance and grants: it will also
need to support investment in charging infrastructure. Not all potential actions depend on
the availability of concessional finance (Box 4.4). For light-duty vehicles, for example,
governments in emerging market and developing economies could introduce differentiated
import duties that favour EVs. They could also consider policy packages that include vehicle
efficiency standards, pollution emissions standards and differential fuel taxation measures.
Box 4.4 ⊳

Role of finance in energy transitions

Achieving the increase in investment in clean energy in the NZE Scenario by 2050 requires
a major reallocation of capital across the energy sector and a reconfiguration of the
global financial infrastructure to accommodate this shift. This holds particularly true if
the investment gap in emerging market and development economies is to be closed, as
about 80% of the world’s financial assets today are currently held in advanced
economies. Finding mechanisms that will enable the channelling of funds at scale to
emerging market and development economies is no easy task, and few proven models
exist today. The challenge is made more difficult by the high upfront costs of key
technologies that are needed as part of clean energy transitions, notably in the power
and end-use sectors. This makes the ability to borrow and service a larger share of debt
and ensure adequate risk-adjusted returns on investment for equity holders critical to
attract investment.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Equity has underpinned the majority of annual energy investments to date and plays a
pivotal role in funding clean energy transitions (IEA, 2021b). It is typically used to fund
early-stage business models, new technologies with high upfront risks and projects that
require long lead times. The availability of equity financing also often underpins
investment in end-use sectors such as energy efficiency or electrification, such as heat
pumps, where transaction sizes are generally smaller but where small and medium size
enterprises face higher lending rates than larger corporate entities.

200

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Although equity funding remains crucial, the capital structure of investment seen in the
NZE Scenario relies on a significant increase in debt financing, with sustainable finance
playing an increasingly important role in channelling funds from capital markets into
clean energy projects. Green and sustainable debt has been developing rapidly in recent
years – it reached USD 1.5 trillion in 2022 – but it still accounts for a small share of global
bond issuances (5% in 2022) and is disproportionately concentrated in advanced
economies (80% of issuances in 2022) (IEA, 2023i). Where issuances in emerging market
and developing economies do occur, they are still dominated by hard currency, exposing
them to foreign exchange risk. In the NZE Scenario, improvements in regulatory
standards in emerging market and developing economies and the rise of large-scale
sovereign issuances mean that green debt products quickly translate into new
investment in clean energy in those countries.
In addition to a rise in debt financing, the NZE Scenario sees more private sector backed
financing, more financing from domestic sources, and more concessional finance
provided by DFIs and specialised mechanisms such as climate finance or carbon markets.
These all contribute to some extent to closing the investment gap in emerging market
and development economies.

What are the implications of our scenarios for investment in oil and gas?
Determining the appropriate level of investment in oil and gas is a fraught and emotive issue
in the energy debate. Some, including large resource-holders and certain oil and gas
companies, maintain that the world is prematurely turning away from investment in oil and
gas, and that the payback for today’s underinvestment, as they see it, will be a period of
sharp fuel price spikes and volatility down the road. Others argue that oil and gas investment
is already unacceptably high given the imperative to tackle climate change, and that further
overinvestment, as they see it, will lock the world to a pathway that pushes global average
temperatures well beyond 1.5 °C.
What do the scenarios tell us about this crucial issue? Four key findings are highlighted:

IEA. CC BY 4.0.



The oil and gas investment message from our analysis of the outlook in the STEPS has
evolved. Until this year, we saw a gap between the amounts being invested in oil and
gas and the future requirements of this scenario. Our recommended solution was to
scale up clean energy spending and thereby reduce the requirement for oil and gas.
What has happened in practice is that oil and gas investment has risen, while the level
of oil and gas investment needed in the STEPS in 2030 has fallen as a result of lower
projections of future oil and gas demand. As a result, current investment levels are
adequate to meet projected supply needs in the STEPS. There is no longer a need – in
any of the scenarios that we model – for oil and gas investment in 2030 to be higher
than it is today Sentiment in the industry seems to be broadly aligned with this view:
less than half of the available cashflows from record revenues in 2022 went back into

Chapter 4 | Secure and people-centred energy transitions

201

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

new oil and gas investment, and current upstream spending remains below where it was
in 2019.


The invasion of Ukraine disrupted the global energy system and resulted in a lower level
of exports of oil and gas from Russia. Consumers needed to adjust to this, and that has
now happened. Shortfalls in supply from Russia are no longer a reason to argue for
higher oil and gas investment.



Today’s level of investment in all fossil fuels, including oil and gas, is significantly higher
than what is needed in the APS and double what is needed in the NZE Scenario in 2030.
This implies that fossil fuel investors think that the STEPS describes the likely future more
accurately than the APS or the NZE Scenario. The current level of investment creates the
clear risk of locking in fossil fuel use and putting the 1.5 °C goal out of reach. However,
simply cutting spending on oil and gas will not get the world on track for the
NZE Scenario – the key is to scale up investment in all aspects of a clean energy system,
especially in emerging market and developing economies, and to meet rising demand
for energy services in a sustainable way.



Both overinvestment and underinvestment in oil and gas carry risks for secure energy
transitions. Evaluating the implications of investments is not straightforward: among
other things, any assessment needs to take into account the source of investment and
the likely efficiency of the spending. Policy makers also need to keep a watchful eye in
this context on trends that could point to a future concentration in supply or other
energy security risks. But when it comes to the overall adequacy of spending, our
analysis suggests that the risks are weighted more towards overinvestment in oil and
gas than the opposite.

Different starting points, different pathways
S U M M A R Y
• This chapter focuses on the prospects for selected countries and regions over the
period to 2050 under the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which considers the current
policy landscape and market conditions, and the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS),
which assumes all long-term commitments are met in full and on time. Together these
selected countries and regions account for nearly 90% of global energy consumption
today.

• The global energy crisis prompted a range of new initiatives, notably in advanced
economies and China, that aim to increase the pace of clean energy deployment.
Measures vary from region to region, but they all tend to place greater emphasis on
boosting the share of renewables in electricity generation, incentivising electric car
sales and improving energy efficiency.

• Energy needs in many emerging market and developing economies are increasing
rapidly, which require major new investment in energy infrastructure ranging from
electricity generation and grids to electric vehicle charging stations. Levels of ambition
vary, but there is a widespread recognition that clean energy technologies can offer
cost-effective solutions for a range of development objectives. Some emerging
market and developing economies face difficulties to obtain financing. Concessional
funding has a role to play in this regard, as do initiatives such as the Just Energy
Transition Partnerships.

• Several countries have adopted policies that encourage the diversification of supply
chains for clean energy technologies. This includes policies to promote clean energy
technology manufacturing, for instance, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United
States, the Net Zero Industry Act in the European Union and the Production Linked
Incentives scheme in India.

• Despite moves by countries to reduce dependence on imported fuels and on
geographically concentrated clean energy technology supply chains, the need for
international trade and co-operation remains strong. No country can expect to be
wholly self-sufficient, and most will continue to depend on imports and exports.
International collaboration on innovation in particular will remain vital in the
development of clean energy technologies.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Today, a number of countries rely heavily on revenue from oil and gas production,
and they face the prospect that these revenues will decline as clean energy transitions
advance. This underlines the need for broader economic diversification to
compensate for falling fossil fuel export revenue in the APS. Some countries are
already taking steps in that direction.

Introduction

The chapter examines selected regions and countries which together account for nearly 90%
of global GDP, population and energy demand. It highlights the specific issues and dynamics
that affect them, taking account of their very different specific circumstances and ambitions.
Starting points for the analysis vary widely and depend on a host of factors that include
population, urbanisation, per capita income, economic structure, availability of natural
resources and geography. Each section includes some common elements that describe the
overarching trajectories for energy and emissions, key findings and the main factors that help
to explain them. Each section also provides insights on one or two topical issues that highlight
distinctive aspects of the projections. Table 5.1 highlights key indicators for the selected
countries and regions.

The United States has mobilised unprecedented levels of government support to boost clean
energy and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Table 5.2). The principal legislative
vehicles are the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, which invests
around USD 190 billion for clean energy and mass transit, and the US Inflation Reduction Act
of 2022, which provides an estimated USD 370 billion in funding to promote energy security
and combat climate change. In the STEPS, these and other initiatives result in a reduction of
nearly 40% in CO2 emissions by 2030, relative to the 2005 level (Figure 5.1).
The largest impact of the increased government support is in the power sector, followed by
transport and industry. In the STEPS, CO2 emissions in 2030 in the power sector are 50%
lower than today. This is largely the result of tax credits that accelerate the deployment of
solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind. The reduction in emissions also reflects support for
lifetime extensions of nuclear power plants, as well as batteries and carbon capture,
utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology. In the transport sector, tax credits for electric cars
and investment in charging infrastructure lead to annual sales of electric cars rising from
1 million in 2022 and 1.6 million in 2023 to close to 8 million in 2030, by which they account
206

for 50% of new car registrations. Technologies that aid emissions reductions in hard-to-abate
industrial sectors, such as CCUS and low-emissions hydrogen, are eligible for substantial tax
credits, which can lay the foundation for strong growth in the years ahead. By attracting
private capital, these incentives collectively support a doubling in clean energy investment
in the United States by 2030 over 2022 levels. There is also a notable increase in cross-cutting
investment in technology innovation.
These investments further accelerate reductions in demand for coal, which faces increasingly
strong competition from renewables and natural gas. In the STEPS, coal demand falls by
almost three-quarters by 2030 relative to the current level, largely thanks to solar PV and
wind increasing their share of electricity generation. Natural gas demand is higher than the
level in 2022 for several years, but peaks in the mid-2020s and then begins to decline, mostly
as a result of lower demand in the power and buildings sectors. Oil demand falls by nearly
2 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2030 from around 18 mb/d today, largely due to rising
electric vehicle (EV) sales and fuel economy improvements.

Exports of oil and gas from the United States are set to pick up in the coming years, in part
because of lower export volumes from Russia (notably for natural gas). In the STEPS, the
United States maintains its status as the world’s largest natural gas exporter through to 2030.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the United States increase by 75% from 2022 levels
to reach 185 billion cubic metres (bcm) by 2030, of which 95 bcm is transported to the
European Union. Efforts to reduce methane emissions, along with efficiency and fuel
switching policies, increase the availability and value proposition of US oil and gas exports.

2050. Its commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 50-52% in 2030 from 2005 levels requires
continuing efforts to accelerate deployment of renewables and other low-emissions
technologies. Scaling up batteries and other forms of storage will also be important, as well
as action to modernise, digitalise and expand grids in a timely manner.

5.2.2

How much have the US Inflation Reduction Act and other recent
policies changed the picture for clean energy transitions?

The Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and other
recent policies have reshaped the US energy outlook. Targeting a broad set of technologies
across many sectors, the incentives now available are making clean energy investment more
attractive, prompting faster deployment of clean energy technologies and the development
of new clean energy manufacturing capacities in the United States. Our updated assessment
in the STEPS clearly demonstrates the significant impact of these policies when compared to
the outlook prior to these policies in the Stated Policies Scenario from the World Energy
Outlook-2021 (hereinafter referenced as WEO-2021 STEPS) (IEA, 2021).

and accelerates the pace of CO2 emissions reductions

The Inflation Reduction Act and other recent policies have significantly improved the outlook
for a host of clean energy technologies. Electric vehicle sales in 2030 are projected in this
World Energy Outlook (WEO-2023) STEPS to be 13-times the 2021 level, compared with just
a threefold increase in WEO-2021 STEPS (Figure 5.2). Carbon capture projects completed by
2030 in the STEPS, including those under construction, are set to capture three-times the
volume of CO2 emissions as in 2021, double the increase projected prior to the Inflation

Reduction Act, while low-emissions hydrogen is now expected to gain much more than the
modest foothold projected in the WEO-2021. Wind and solar PV have also benefited
significantly from the support now available for clean energy technologies. As a result of
these changes, energy-related CO2 emissions decline to 3.6 gigatonnes (Gt) by 2030 in the
STEPS, 10% below the level in 2030 projected in the WEO-2021 STEPS. The power sector
accounts for most of the difference, followed by transport and industry, but all sectors make
a contribution. The accelerated progress made by 2030 also paves the way for more rapid
progress in succeeding years: emissions in 2050 are now projected to be one-third below the
level expected before the Inflation Reduction Act came into force.

nuclear lifetime extensions and leads to an 80% reduction in unabated coal power by 2030

In the power sector, the boost provided by the Inflation Reduction Act for both existing and
new low-emissions sources of electricity accelerates the transition away from coal-fired
generation and reduces CO2 emissions. If all the conditions are met to receive the maximum
available tax credits for solar and wind, then the levelised cost to consumers of new solar PV
and wind in the United States is expected to be lower than anywhere else in the world. These
incentives are attracting private investors. By 2030, solar PV output surpasses 800 terawatthours (TWh) in the STEPS (two-thirds above the level projected in WEO-2021 STEPS) and
wind reaches 1 000 TWh (almost 50% above the level in the WEO-2021 STEPS) (Figure 5.3).
Tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act also support lifetime extensions of nuclear power
plants, which are one of the cheapest sources of low-emissions electricity. As a result of these
various incentives, unabated coal-fired power falls by about 80% in the STEPS, compared
with about 50% in the WEO-2021 STEPS. Unabated natural gas-fired generation also declines
by more than projected prior to the Inflation Reduction Act.

Clean energy manufacturing
In recent years, clean energy manufacturing has been insufficient to meet domestic needs in
the United States. For example, in 2022, the domestic content of wind turbine blades and
hubs was about half and only one-third of solar PV modules were produced domestically.
While imports of clean energy components will continue, and would benefit from more
supply diversity, the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant incentives to boost domestic
clean energy manufacturing in the interests of maximising the domestic benefits of the
transition to clean energy and of national security. These incentives have resulted in a
number of announcements from companies looking to develop new clean energy
manufacturing capabilities in the United States, including plans for the production of
hydrogen, batteries, solar PV and wind turbines (Table 5.3). The United States has witnessed
a surge in announcements of large manufacturing facilities over the past year. Gigafactory
capacity, expected to remain operational until 2030, increased from 750 gigawatt-hours
(GWh) in July 2022 to 1.2 TWh by September 2023, due in large part to the support in the
Inflation Reduction Act (Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, 2023).

production

• Aim to reach over 5.5 Mt of hydrogen by 2030 (mainly coupled with CCUS).
• Top-five projects account for around half of the capacity target. The largest project would
produce 1 Mt of hydrogen per year and be online in 2028.

Batteries

• Aim for production capacity of 1.2 TWh by 2030, about 12-times the current level.
• Top-five projects account for one-third of the capacity target. Tesla alone has announced
260 GWh production capacity by 2030.

Solar PV

• Exceeding 40 GW production capacity for solar modules by 2030, up from 7 GW today.

Wind

• 1.5 GW production capacity of offshore nacelles by the end of this decade.

An increase in manufacturing capacities will help the United States to create more resilient
supply chains for clean energy technologies, though these will inevitably take time to
develop. Around USD 150 billion in planned investment has been announced so far for key
technologies, including batteries, EVs, charging infrastructure, offshore wind, and solar (US
Department of Energy, 2023). With these investments, the United States is likely to be able
to meet all or most of its domestic needs for hydrogen electrolysers, EV and stationary
battery deployment by 2030. However, even with a sixfold increase in solar PV module
manufacturing, the United States would still only produce about 10% of what is needed for
2030 deployment in the STEPS. The figure for wind is even lower, and there have been few
announcements so far about planned increases in domestic manufacturing capacity for wind
power components. Ensuring resilient and diverse international supply chains is therefore
going to remain important as clean energy deployment ramps up.

Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is a diverse and strategically important region with
strong connections to major global markets. It comprises 8% of the world population and 7%
of global GDP and is one of the most highly urbanised regions in the world, with 82% of its
people living in cities. Its economy today is closely tied to the production of fuels, minerals
and food for export, exposing it to volatility in international markets and price cycles. The
region is coming out of a “lost decade” of economic growth punctuated by the
Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis. Curbing high inflation and pursuing
opportunities in the new energy economy could help to spur an economic rebound.
Half of the countries in LAC have pledged to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century or
earlier. They account for around 65% of the LAC GDP and 60% of its energy-related CO2
emissions. To reach these goals, LAC countries need not only to speed up the deployment of
clean energy technologies but also to tackle deforestation. While energy accounts for about
less than half of total GHG emissions in the region, agriculture and land-use change play an
outsized role, and they are responsible respectively for 25% and 20% of total GHG emissions.

Total energy supply in LAC is set to increase as a result of population and economic growth.
In the STEPS, energy supply increases by 10% from 2022 to 2030 and 35% by 2050, with the
share of supply that comes from fossil fuels decreasing slightly as deployment of renewables
increases. The slight decrease in the share of fossil fuels in energy supply is not enough to
prevent energy-related CO2 emissions in the region from rising 10% higher than current levels
in 2050 (Figure 5.4).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, electricity demand rises over time, twice as fast as fossil fuels. Final energy
consumption in LAC today is primarily oil, most of which is used in transport, but the share
of oil is set to decline as countries seek alternative transport fuels: Brazil leads in biofuel
adoption, while Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica and Mexico are prioritising the rapid uptake of
EVs. Expanding ownership of appliances and air conditioners leads to higher use of electricity
in LAC households: by 2050, two-thirds of energy in the buildings sector is electricity. The
industry sector in LAC is less energy intensive than the global average, with non-energy
intensive sectors (especially the food sector) accounting for 45% of industrial energy demand
(compared to 30% globally), and their use of electricity also increases. Electricity in LAC today
is primarily from hydropower and natural gas, but solar PV and wind make up the vast
majority of new electricity supply in the STEPS. Low-emissions sources, which accounted for
over 60% of total generation in 2022, rise to over 80% by 2050. Natural gas remains the
largest fossil fuel, and it is the only fossil fuel that sees an increment on its output of almost
25%, while coal and oil use decline by at least 75% over the period.
In the APS, meeting NDCs and net zero emissions targets cuts energy-related CO2 emissions
by 10% by 2030 and 50% by 2050, relative to the 2022 level (Table 5.4). Energy efficiency
plays a key role in moderating electricity demand increases in the buildings sector, while
212

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

further electrification of transport helps to reduce the share of fossil fuels in total primary
energy supply from two-thirds today to below 60% in 2030. As a result, LAC makes significant
contributions to global clean energy transitions, accounting for almost 10% of the global
reduction in oil use by 2050 and about 5% of the reduced use of natural gas. Cleaner energy
sources, more stringent environmental policies and better access to clean cooking also help
to reduce air pollution, a major cause of poor health in the region. The new energy economy
that emerges in the APS sets the stage for LAC to tap its abundant renewable energy
resources to produce low-emissions hydrogen for both domestic use and export.

5.3.2

What role for Latin America and the Caribbean in maintaining
traditional oil and gas security through energy transitions?

The global energy crisis has raised energy security questions for many net importing
countries, potentially creating an opportunity for producers and resource-rich countries in
the LAC region to step up their own production and export. This section examines how these
opportunities play out in our scenarios, and also considers some of the commercial and
environmental risks.
Today the region is already a net crude oil exporter: in the STEPS and APS it is poised to play
a growing role in global oil production and trade. In the APS, oil production increases while
oil demand declines up to 2035 in LAC, raising net exports from 0.6 mb/d in 2022 to 2.3 mb/d
in 2035. The growth is concentrated in Guyana and Brazil. Reliance on export markets makes
these projections highly sensitive to the pace of global transitions, which vary substantially
across our scenarios depending on the strength of government policies. Demand in the APS
continues to allow for some new upstream developments if they are competitive on cost and
exhibit low-emissions intensities, but new oil and gas fields around the world would face
major commercial risks if global demand follows the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)
Scenario pathway that limits global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Guyana discovered very large oil reserves offshore in 2015 and accounted for more than half
of LAC crude discoveries and 7% of global crude discoveries from 2015 to 2023. In the APS,
Guyana increases oil production by 1.3 mb/d from 2022 to 2035 (Figure 5.5), the largest
increase of any country in this scenario. With a population under 1 million, nearly all of
Guyana’s expanded oil production is available for export. The boost in oil exports generates
more diversity of oil supply even as overall global demand starts to decline. It also provides
an opportunity to support Guyana’s development if a comprehensive governance framework
for the sector is in place (Balza et al., 2020) Guyana quadrupled oil exports from 2020 to
2022, with about half of delivered cargoes in 2022 going to the European Union to help
replace Russian oil and a further one-third to Asia.
Brazil accounts for the second-largest increase in oil production in the world to 2035, at
around 1 mb/d. Brazil has been the largest oil producer in LAC since 2016, having overtaken
both Venezuela and Mexico: it continues to hold this position through to 2050 in the APS,
accounting for about 5% of global production from 2030 to 2050. All the additional oil
produced in Brazil is likely to go for export: current key export markets include China,
European Union, India and United States.

Argentina has the potential to significantly expand its production of natural gas, which would
have the effect of reducing net imports to the LAC region. Higher output in Argentina would
compensate for reduced output in several other producers. Trinidad and Tobago is the
second-largest natural gas producer in LAC today and a major exporter of LNG, but its 2022
production was 20% below a recent high in 2019, and it falls by another 30% to 2030 in the
APS. Overall, LAC remains a net importer of natural gas in the APS, though the import
volumes declines sharply after 2030, making more than 50 bcm available to other markets.

Do critical minerals open new avenues for Latin America and the
Caribbean’s natural resources?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Rising demand for clean energy technologies offers significant scope for LAC to expand
production and export of critical minerals, building on its well-established mining sector and
significant minerals reserves. In doing so, it could help the global economy avoid the supply
bottlenecks that might threaten clean energy transitions. The region already produces large
quantities of lithium, which is essential for almost all types of EVs and storage batteries
today, and of copper, which underpins the expansion of renewables and electricity networks.
LAC could expand into a range of other materials such as nickel – a key component in
batteries and electrolysers – and the rare earth elements that are required for EV motors
and wind turbines. There are three key opportunities in this respect: scale up production,
including undeveloped resources; improve practices for responsible and sustainable supply;
and move from the production of ores to processed products.
LAC accounts for 40% of global production of copper, led by Chile (24%) and Peru (10%).
Copper production started to pick up in 2022 after several flat years. Both countries made a

sizeable contribution to production growth and now have expansion projects underway. A
mega-port is under construction in Peru to facilitate exports. The national mining plan in
Chile includes a copper production target of 7 Mt by 2030, up from 5.7 Mt today, and 9 Mt
by 2050, alongside a doubling in annual investment in greenfield exploration.
LAC supplies 35% of global lithium and holds around half of lithium reserves. It is home to
the so-called “lithium triangle” – a lithium-rich region that spans Argentina, Bolivia and Chile.
Today, Chile accounts for 30% and Argentina for 5% of global lithium production. Bolivia also
has substantial lithium resources: a lack of infrastructure has so far hindered them from
being economically lucrative, but CATL, a Chinese firm, plans to invest over USD 1 billion in a
lithium project in Bolivia. So far, lithium mining has been concentrated on the salt flats of
Chile, but the Kachi mine is expected to begin operations in Argentina in 2024, and the Grota
do Cirilos mine has just started production in Brazil.

combined fossil fuel production in the region, which falls to USD 145 billion as countries
around the world deliver on announced pledges to limit the impacts of climate change. In
the NZE, the revenues from critical minerals production rise further to USD 246 billion by
2050.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has had profound effects on the energy sector in the European
Union. Vast sums were spent on energy in 2022: the European Union paid over
USD 300 billion for natural gas imports in 2022, a threefold increase compared to the average
of the previous five years. This fed through to much higher end-user prices for both natural
gas and electricity. Even though governments made far-reaching interventions to cushion
the impacts and reduce demand, and the well-integrated EU energy markets helped to
manage supply risks, spending on energy use in buildings, transport and industry in the EU
in 2022 rose above USD 2 trillion, equivalent to 12% of GDP.
In response to the energy crisis, the European Union raised its clean energy ambitions, while
placing energy security at the forefront of its transition plans. This is already visible in the
STEPS: oil and gas demand is projected to come down by 15% by 2030 from 2022 levels, and
coal demand by 55%. Large legislative packages and a raft of national and EU-level incentives,
representing almost USD 500 billion in enacted funding for clean energy investment are
reflected in the STEPS; renewables make up two-thirds of electricity generation in 2030, up
216

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

from 39% in 2022, with wind and solar PV accounting for over 85% of the new capacity built
in this period. In the APS, the more ambitious EU Fit for 55 package targets are largely met,
ensuring that the European Union achieves a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030
relative to 1990 levels, and also meets the REPowerEU goal of eliminating dependence on
Russian natural gas before 2030. This requires a 20% increase in renewables deployment
compared to the STEPS in 2030.

Electrification of the energy economy in the European Union occurs in parallel with
decarbonisation of the power sector. The share of electricity in total final energy
consumption in 2030 is 25% in the STEPS and nearly 30% in the APS, compared with 21% in
2022. EVs account for 55% of electricity demand growth by 2050: in the STEPS, there are 200
million electric cars on the road by 2050 compared with around 6 million today; 85% of the
vehicles on the road are electric. In the APS, this share reaches nearly 90%. Demand for heat
in the buildings sector is also electrified: more than 330 GW of heat pumps are deployed by
2030 in the APS.
Strong support for building retrofits, appliance efficiency standards and fuel switching
incentives remains crucial to complement the electrification of heating in the buildings
sector, given that over 70% of the residential buildings stock in 2050 already stands today.
The energy intensity of the buildings stock improves by about 30% per square metre in the
STEPS by 2050 and almost 50% in the APS.

5.4.2

Can the European Union deliver on its clean energy and critical
materials targets?

The European Union’s clean energy ambitions require a large quantity of raw materials, and
it is currently highly dependent on imports. Like many other regions responding to postCovid-19 pressures on supply chains and the fallout from the global energy crisis, the
European Union has sought to promote investment in domestic production as a way to
increase the resilience of energy supply chains. While recognising the benefits of trade and
the importance of international co-operation, the proposed EU Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA)
would require the EU clean manufacturing capacity to reach at least 40% of deployment
needs by 2030, while the proposed European Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) would
require 10% of the EU annual consumption to be extracted in the region, and less than 65%
of its annual consumption of each mineral to have been processed in a third country.

Wind and heat pump project pipelines are in line with EU minimum domestic

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Notes: Country share in world technology manufacturing is estimated based on current project pipeline for
2030. Lithium supply mix is based on 2022 extraction data. EU production targets reflect minimum domestic
manufacturing and extraction targets from the Net Zero Industry and the Critical Raw Materials Acts.

Around 10% of the 40 GW of solar PV modules that were added in the European Union in
2022 were manufactured in the region. By 2030, if all planned projects are commissioned on
time and in full, this share would be just over 20% when benchmarked against the
deployments needs of the APS, where solar PV capacity additions reach over 50 GW in 2030
(Figure 5.8). For wind, EU production of nacelles – the generating components on the top of
turbines – came close to matching the 14 GW of capacity added in 2022. The current pipeline
for new wind manufacturing capacity however is much smaller than for PV, and so the
218

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

projected near-tripling of wind capacity additions in the APS by 2030 would mean the EU
manufactured share falls just short of 40% by that date. Significant additional investment in
manufacturing capacity in the European Union, particularly solar PV, would be needed to
meet the goals of the NZIA and CRMA. Imports remain crucial in any scenario, with overall
cross-border trade dictated by cost competitiveness and the pipeline of manufacturing
capacity in other parts of the world: current plans suggest that China is likely to retain its
strong position in wind and solar PV manufacturing.
The European Union is better placed to meet increased demand for heat pumps. There is
already enough capacity to meet close to 40% of the heat pump sales that are required in
the APS in 2030, and a sizeable pipeline of additional projects means that aggregate EU
production capacity is roughly equivalent to projected demand in this scenario.
Current lithium extraction capacity in the European Union would meet less than 0.5% of its
needs in 2030. Several new projects have been announced in recent years, including Czech
Republic, Finland, Germany and Portugal. If all announced projects come online as planned,
EU regional extraction capacity could meet 10% of deployment rates in the APS, thereby
delivering on the CRMA target. Nevertheless, most of the lithium that the European Union
requires will still need to be imported. In both its raw and refined forms, global lithium
production is highly concentrated, with raw supply dominated by Chile, Australia and China,
and refined lithium produced almost exclusively by China. This suggests a need to strengthen
efforts to form strategic partnerships to develop projects that will diversify supply chains.

5.4.3

What next for the natural gas balance in the European Union?

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union reduced its natural gas
demand by an historic 55 bcm in 2022, equivalent to 13% of total demand in 2021. In the
STEPS, continued efforts to decrease demand yield a further 50 bcm reduction by 2030. In
the APS, acceleration in end-use electrification, efficiency and renewables expansion means
demand is 60 bcm lower still in 2030 and falls below 30 bcm by 2050.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

This trajectory raises the question of how to satisfy the EU near-term need for additional
natural gas supplies without compromising long-term emissions reduction goals, and what
the appropriate contracting and investment strategies should look like. Currently, the gap
between firm contracted supply and projected import requirements in the STEPS lies in a
range between 160 bcm and 180 bcm annually over the projection period. If no further
contracts are signed, this implies a continued high level of reliance on spot markets or shortterm contracts, underpinned primarily by flexible volumes of LNG. This gap also exists in the
APS in the near term, though it narrows sharply after 2030. While these outcomes illustrate
that EU gas buyers face a good deal of uncertainty about future requirements, a remaining
gap of 20 bcm in the APS in 2050 suggests there is still space to contract more gas without
falling foul of the European Union net zero emissions by 2050 target (Figure 5.9).
Whether these contracts are at odds with global ambitions to reach net zero emissions is
another matter. The global LNG market looks amply supplied in the second-half of the 2020s,
and no new projects are necessary in the APS or the NZE Scenario, so sourcing additional gas
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

219

from existing projects may be better aligned with near-term security goals and global climate
ambitions than signing contracts supporting new long lead time projects. EU gas buyers could
contract for flexible supply on a long-term basis and redirect it elsewhere if it is not needed,
but this would increase their risk exposure if global demand for gas fell in line with a rapid
transition to clean energy along the lines of the NZE Scenario. Buyers might instead be
comfortable with a high reliance on spot markets; the crisis has revealed Europe’s willingness
to pay a premium for LNG and the market’s ability to respond by sourcing the supplies
necessary to fill storage and meet demand. However, this strategy could have knock-on
impacts on other importing countries, damaging their security of supply and risking increased
use of coal as a fallback option.

reductions and the willingness of EU buyers to rely on global spot markets

The question of whether the scramble to build new LNG import terminals and reinforce
pipeline links in Europe ends up locking in emissions is also an important one. Investment
costs for such infrastructure are relatively modest by comparison with those involved in
developing export infrastructure, and import terminals and pipeline links do not necessarily
require high rates of utilisation over a long period of time. Where import takes the form of
floating storage and regasification units, it is also relatively flexible and can be moved as
demand for natural gas evolves. In the STEPS, cumulative spending on LNG import capacity
between 2022 and 2030 is USD 55 billion, and this rises to USD 70 billion in the APS. A figure
in the range of USD 55-70 billion represents around 0.3% of total EU spending on energy over
this period, and arguably provides important energy security benefits over the transition
period. There is also the possibility that some gas infrastructure could be repurposed in the
future to transport hydrogen.

The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent energy crisis contributed to an emerging debt crisis
in Africa and a worsening economic outlook. One consequence is that energy investment is
set to remain low in the STEPS, contributing to slow progress in extending access to electricity
and clean cooking in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 5.10). Today, more than 40% of people living
in Africa lack access to electricity and 70% lack access to clean cooking. Africa will be home
to one-fifth of the world’s population by 2030 and providing access to modern energy for all
while keeping pace with rising energy demand remains a primary focus for African
governments (IEA, 2022a).
Recent policy efforts have focussed on reversing flagging investment with support from
multilateral development banks and development finance institutions (IEA, 2023a). Climate
commitments among international lenders have made renewable power projects easier to
finance than most others, and renewables account for half of all capacity additions since the
pandemic. With solar leading the way, renewables are set to contribute over 80% of new
power generation capacity to 2030 in the STEPS, a figure which rises to around 85% in the

APS. Natural gas power plants make up most of the balance outside of South Africa: in
addition to providing power, they help shore up grid stability and provide scope for the
operation of regional power pools such as the West African Power Pool. In the APS, new
natural gas power still comes online in sub-Saharan Africa, however, North Africa sees limited
growth to 2030, relying largely on renewables to meet incremental energy demand
consistent with long-term climate pledges.
In South Africa, representing 27% of current electricity demand in Africa, load-shedding has
intensified as a result of unplanned outages at numerous coal plants, prompting a substantial
uptick in renewables investment in the STEPS, even though other aspects of the South
African Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) remain undecided. Despite supply
shortages, no new coal-fired power plants are started in the STEPS, consistent with
international commitments to end investment in new coal plants. By 2030, the share of lowemissions electricity generation reaches over 40% in the STEPS in South Africa, rising from
12% today. This rises further to over half in the APS.

Africa’s growing energy needs will mean a degree of reliance on fossil fuels for some time
before a full transition takes place to clean energy technologies. These fossil fuels include oil
for transport, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking and natural gas for industry. In the
STEPS, an expanding vehicle fleet increases road transport demand for oil by 15% in 2030.
Except for two/three-wheelers, vehicle electrification makes little progress by 2030,
hindered by high upfront costs and unreliable grids. In the APS, the market share of electric
cars reaches 5% by 2030, with age limits on imported vehicles starting to bring second-hand
electric cars into the market. LPG demand rises slowly in the absence of well-funded clean
cooking policies: it would need to increase twofold, and threefold in sub-Saharan Africa to
be consistent with universal access to clean cooking by 2030. Africa’s industries use a range
of fuels but rely in particular on the use of natural gas, especially for fertiliser production,
water desalination, plus the steel and cement industries.
222

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

While demand for oil and gas in Africa continues to climb, prospects for new oil and gas
projects are changing due to global trends, which carries implications for current and future
producers. Africa currently produces 7 mb/d of crude oil, of which around 40% is exported.
Oil production is projected to decline, with limited new oil discoveries coming online that will
not outpace declines from producing fields. Africa becomes a net importer of oil in the mid2030s in the STEPS. In the APS, oil production is 0.5 mb/d lower than in STEPS by 2030. Many
African countries rely on imports of refined products, although a new 650 000 barrels per
day refinery in Nigeria helps meet incremental oil product demand growth in the next
decade.
Prospects for new natural gas developments fare better. In the STEPS, natural gas production
reaches 280 bcm by 2030, from a level around 260 bcm today. Large discoveries have been
made across the continent over the last decade, and many African countries are looking to
develop these resources, both for export and domestic use. Net income from oil and gas
production averages USD 140 billion each year in the STEPS between 2022 and 2030, which
falls to 130 billion in the APS.
The decline in oil and gas export revenues in the APS could be problematic for a number of
current and prospective producer economies, but clean energy technologies and the critical
minerals on which they depend hold great promise for Africa, and some countries are well
positioned to become future producers. Today Africa accounts for 13% of global copper and
battery metals revenue, and this could rise: a number of countries have expressed interest
in attracting international investment to develop and process their resources.

5.5.2

Recharging progress towards universal energy access

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The Covid-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, debt problems and political instability have nearly
eliminated progress in Africa on reducing the number of people without access to electricity
since its peak in 2013. Today there are around 600 million people without access to
electricity in Africa (Figure 5.11), and they constitute around 80% of the global population
without access. Although preliminary data suggest that the number of people without access
in Africa might stabilise in 2023 after three years of increases, efforts need to scale up quickly
to reach global access goals. The STEPS sees leading countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya,
Ghana and Senegal reach or get very close to their targets, but the number of those without
electricity access continue to rise in many others. While utility debts and supply chain
constraints have slowed grid electricity access investment, solar home systems sales rose to
record levels in 2022 and contributed to half of the increase of people with access in subSaharan Africa in 2022. Solar home systems now provide access to electricity to more than
8% of households in sub-Saharan Africa that have access, and they are set to play an
increasingly important role this decade in providing first-time access to households in Africa.
The number of people without access to clean cooking in Africa reached almost 990 million
in 2022. It is still rising, and many African countries are not on course to achieve universal
access to clean cooking even by 2050. Reaching universal access to clean cooking by 2030 in
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

223

5

line with Sustainable Development Goal 7 requires the rapid scaling up of all clean cooking
technologies. As a feasible, low cost technology, LPG is set to play a leading role: it provides
clean cooking to 40% of those gaining access. Electric cooking also has an important role: it
provides access to 12% of homes in sub-Saharan Africa and has the additional benefit of not
requiring fuel imports (IEA, 2023b). Between now and 2030, improved biomass cookstoves
provide clean cooking to more than one-third of those gaining access, mainly in rural areas.
For many, however, this is a transitional step before they gain access to clean cooking at a
later date through LPG, electricity, biodigesters or ethanol cookstoves. Switching to any clean
cooking solution in sub-Saharan Africa reduces GHG emissions, even after taking account of
increased CO2 emissions from fossil fuel consumption, and this makes clean cooking a prime
candidate for climate finance.

What can be done to enhance energy investment in Africa?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Meeting Africa’s rising energy demand, providing universal access to modern energy by 2030
and achieving energy and climate goals means more than doubling energy investment this
decade. This requires over USD 200 billion per year from 2026 to 2030, with two-thirds going
to clean energy (Figure 5.12). Bringing access to electricity and clean cooking for all Africans
requires investment of USD 25 billion per year – a relatively small part of the total – and
equivalent to just 1% of current global energy investment.

224

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Energy investment in Africa, however, has fallen by almost 45% from highs in 2014 largely as
a result of a slowdown in oil and gas investment. While export-oriented oil and gas projects
are able to attract commercial financing, there are fewer bankable clean energy projects,
and those that are put forward struggle to secure financing. Potential investors are often
concerned by risks stemming from relatively weak regulatory environments or the poor
financial health of utilities. These risks can reduce the commercial viability of projects,
particularly in countries with nascent clean energy sectors. They can also push up the cost of
borrowing to at least two- to three-times the level in advanced economies for similar projects
(IEA, 2023c).
As a result, many projects in Africa require concessional support either to act as a
demonstration project or to facilitate the mobilisation of private capital. By the end of the
decade, concessional finance to mobilise private capital needs to reach around USD 28 billion
per year if all energy and climate goals in Africa are to be achieved. This total would be higher
in the NZE Scenario. The limited availability of domestic public financing means that
additional grant and concessional support are also necessary to support non-commercial
activities such as early-stage financing and the development of early-stage technologies. The
communique issued by African governments at the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi in
September 2023 called for advanced economies to meet their climate finance commitments
and for reform of the multilateral finance system to address the lack of energy investment
on the continent today.

Among emerging market and developing economies, the Middle East collectively is at the
upper end of income and energy consumption levels, although there is a wide degree of
variation among countries within the region. As a group, GDP per capita in the Middle East
region is 80% higher than in emerging market and developing economies on average, while
energy demand per capita is over twice as high. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates are at the higher end of per capita incomes and energy consumption,
while others such as Yemen and Syria are at the lower end.
The GDP growth rate of 6.6% in 2022 in the Middle East was nearly twice as high as the
average for emerging market and developing economies as a whole. Saudi Arabia, the largest
economy in this region, grew nearly 9% in 2022. Regional GDP is on track to increase by nearly
30% by the end of the decade and about 2.4-times the current levels by 2050, leading to
energy demand growth in the STEPS of more than 15% by 2030 and 50% by 2050. The region
would have the second-largest oil demand growth and the largest natural gas demand
growth of any region, together with 30% increase in annual CO2 emissions by 2050.
226

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Natural gas and oil made up 94% of the regional electricity mix in 2022. In the STEPS, power
generation from natural gas increases, but the overall share of oil and gas nevertheless
decreases to just over 60% by mid-century as a result of an over twenty-fold rise in
generation by renewables, led by solar PV. By 2030, solar power generation rises ninefold in
the STEPS, and its share of generation rises from 1% today to nearly 10%.
Natural gas and oil also make up the bulk of current energy investment spending in the
Middle East region, with clean energy investment accounting for just 15% of total
investment. In the STEPS, clean energy investment increases fourfold to over USD 90 billion
by 2050, by which time it represents over a third of the total. This falls short of the trajectory
implied by the region’s decarbonisation goals, including national net zero emissions
commitments. In the APS, which assumes that all these commitments are met, clean energy
investment increases fourfold to reach nearly USD 80 billion by 2030, taking the share of
clean energy investment to nearly half of the total. In power generation, this investment
leads to renewables accounting for a sharply rising share of generation, 15% of the electricity
generation by 2030 and a two-thirds share by 2050, with solar PV alone responsible for nearly
half of all the electricity generated by 2050. In transport, sales of electric cars in total car
sales increase to 13% by 2030 in the APS, compared with 5% in the STEPS.
In the APS, oil and gas demand in the region remains flat, but CO2 emissions nevertheless fall
by 12% from current levels by 2050 as a result of energy efficiency improvements and a larger
share of oil being used for chemical feedstocks and therefore not being combusted. The
decline in CO2 emissions in the region is much less than that for the emerging market and
developing economies as a whole, where it falls by nearly 60% in the APS by 2050; the
difference reflects a relatively slower uptake of clean energy in the Middle East.

Shifting fortunes for energy exports

The Middle East has five of the world’s top-ten oil producers – Saudi Arabia, Iraq, United Arab
Emirates, Iran and Kuwait. In 2022, the Middle East produced 31 mb/d of oil, of which nearly
three-quarters was exported, accounting for over four-in-ten barrels of global oil exports.
The region is also a major producer of natural gas with three of the world’s top-ten
producers. Around 85% of gas production is used within the region, while only 26% in the
case of oil, which accounts for the vast majority of energy export earnings. In the STEPS, the
share of the Middle East in global oil production increases steadily, and this is reflected in
higher export earnings by mid-century. These exports are increasingly directed to Asia: the
route between the Middle East and Asia already accounts for around 40% of total seaborne
crude oil trade, and in the STEPS this rises to 50% by 2050.

Despite strong growth of hydrogen production in the Middle East, revenues from their
exports do not offset the decline in oil and gas export revenues in the APS even by 2050
Note: H2 = hydrogen; MER = market exchange rate.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Strengthened climate commitments by countries around the world imply marked changes in
revenue streams from oil and gas in the Middle East. Shrinking global oil demand in the APS
substantially reduces export demand, resulting in a reduction of more than USD 80 billion in
energy export revenues by 2030 and over USD 300 billion by 2050, which is equivalent to less
than half of today’s levels (Figure 5.14). To compensate, several countries in the region are
actively pursuing diversification strategies that aim to open new industrial and export
opportunities such as hydrogen production.

228

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

The Middle East has significant potential for the production of low-emissions fuels, and this
is an important pillar in many transition strategies. Oman, for example, aims to produce at
least 1 million tonnes (Mt) of low-emissions hydrogen a year by 2030 and almost 4 Mt by
2040. The 2040 hydrogen target would represent 80% of Oman’s current LNG exports in
energy-equivalent terms. In the APS, the share of hydrogen in the region’s energy exports
grows larger still. The revenue stream from hydrogen trade, however, is not sufficient to
make up for declining oil and gas revenues. The larger prize is the potential to attract
investment in higher value-added industrial sectors, based on the region’s large potential for
low-cost renewables and for storing CO2.

5.6.3

How is the desalination sector changing in times of increasing
water needs and the energy transition?

The Middle East has one of the lowest levels of fresh water on a per capita basis in the world:
climate change is likely to impose further constraints on water supply in the future. With a
growing population and easy access to sea water, desalination is increasingly being used to
tackle water scarcity. Some 21 000 seawater desalination plants are currently in operation
worldwide, and the Middle East accounts for 50% of the installed capacity (IFRI, 2022).
Moreover, multiple large projects are underway that will increase desalination capacity in
the region: Jordan is planning a major plant on the Gulf of Aqaba that will increase its
desalination capacity from 4 billion to 350 billion litres each year; Saudi Arabia plans to
construct a new city with 9 million people in the northwest by 2045 which will depend on
desalinated water from the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba (Al-Masri and Chenoweth, 2023).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Plans to invest in low-emissions hydrogen production will add to water demand. Production
plans in Oman are based on producing hydrogen from desalinated sea water, for example
(IEA, 2023d). Typically, between 30 and 60 litres of purified water are needed to produce
1 kilogramme (kg) of hydrogen from electrolysis, including feedstock water and process
water for cooling. However, while electrolytic hydrogen production would increase water
demand, a reduction in fossil fuel production could decrease water consumption for oil and
gas extraction and processing.
Desalination is also highly energy intensive. The main energy-related needs for desalinated
water are for cooling thermal plants and for upstream oil and gas operations. The 1.5 EJ
currently consumed every year for municipal desalination in the Middle East is equivalent to
a third of the energy needs of the region’s massive chemical sector, and accounts for 6% of
the total energy consumption in the Middle East (Figure 5.15). Although membrane
technologies such as reverse osmosis that use electricity are the most common desalination
technologies installed worldwide, the Middle East is an exception: the low cost of oil and gas
and the prevalence of co-generation facilities for power and water mean the region relies
heavily on fossil fuel-based thermal desalination such as multi-stage flash or multiple-effect
desalination. Today, two-thirds of the water produced from seawater desalination in the
region is from fossil fuel-based thermal desalination, and much of the membrane-based
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

desalination uses electricity produced with natural gas. Overall, the Middle East accounts for
roughly 90% of the thermal energy used for desalination worldwide, led by the United Arab
Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Announced pledges affect the energy mix of desalination only marginally, but a clean
technology shift is needed as hydrogen production boosts rising water demand
Note: TFC = total final consumption.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, growing desalination demand pushes the share of desalination in total energy
consumption to 10% in 2030 and 15% in 2050. Although the share of membrane-based
desalination using electricity expands to almost 20% by 2030, demand for fossil fuels for
desalination still rises by 70% to 2.3 EJ. In the APS, a smaller temperature increase translates
into reduced demand for water, and as a result energy demand for desalination is 6% lower
in 2030 than in the STEPS. However, there is still considerable scope to move further towards
a more efficient and cleaner membrane-based desalination and to make more use of
concentrating solar power to meet rising water needs. There are also other ways of reducing
demand for water. There is considerable potential to minimise the water required in
hydrogen production by optimising the electrolysis cooling process. Pricing has a role to play
too: consistent under-pricing of both water and energy has encouraged the inefficient use of
water and contributed to unsustainable levels of withdrawals from non-renewable
groundwater resources. Policies that explicitly encourage the conservation of water could
temper the growth for desalination demand further. In the APS, these shifts reduce CO2
emissions from desalination in 2030 by almost 15 Mt compared with the STEPS.

The countries of the Caspian region and Russia (referred to here as Eurasia) are facing
multiple pressures on their energy sectors, intensified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Traditional energy relationships have been fractured or, in some cases, have broken down
completely. Russia is pivoting to new markets in Asia, but lacks infrastructure to reach them.
Starting points vary, but the region as a whole has yet to deploy clean energy at scale. At
175 gigajoules (GJ) of total energy supplied per person, per capita energy consumption in
Eurasia is high compared to the global average of about 80 GJ per person, and the average
of other emerging market and developing economies at 60 GJ per person. This level of energy
consumption in part reflects cold winters, but it also stems from widespread inefficiencies in
energy supply and use.
GDP per capita in Eurasia is around 30% higher than the global average. The region is highly
dependent on industry, which accounts for nearly 40% of its GDP. The power sector is the
biggest energy consumer, accounting for 44% of total energy demand; buildings and industry
make up around a quarter of total energy demand each. The region is heavily reliant on fossil
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

231

fuels, which accounted for 90% of total energy supply in 2022. This share is projected to
decline slowly over time as deployment of renewables accelerates and additional nuclear
power plants are commissioned: by 2050, it comes down to about 85% in the STEPS and 75%
in the APS. The relatively high proportion of fossil fuel use in 2050 in both scenarios and the
relatively small difference between the two scenario outcomes are a reflection of the
weakness of the region’s stated climate ambitions in the energy sector.
In the STEPS, natural gas demand across Eurasia stays almost unchanged until 2050 at around
640 bcm. Small reductions in natural gas use in power generation are offset by increases in
other end-use sectors, notably in industry. Oil consumption rises by 8% to reach 4.7 mb/d by
mid-century. The only fossil fuel that sees a large decline in the STEPS is coal, which drops by
a third to 165 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2050. In the APS, natural gas use
sees a reduction of one-quarter by 2050, mostly owing to lower gas use in the power and
buildings sectors. Oil demand declines by 8% over the same period as the buildings sector
reduces oil use by a third and the power sector by nearly 75%. Coal demand declines by 50%
as coal use in the power sector is cut by more than half and consumption in industry drops
by nearly a third.
Electricity consumption is projected to increase by around 45% in the STEPS, rising from
about 1 050 TWh today to more than 1 500 TWh by 2050. It climbs slightly higher in the APS
as a result of increased electrification of end-uses in that scenario. The share of lowemissions sources in the electricity mix increases relatively slowly from 34% in 2022 to nearly
45% by 2050 in the STEPS and nearly 60% in the APS. The difference between the outcomes
in these scenarios reflects a more rapid deployment of wind and solar PV in the APS, which
sees these two technologies together provide about 20% of electricity by 2050.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Energy-related CO2 emissions in Eurasia amounted to nearly 2.4 Gt in 2022. In the STEPS,
clean energy investment more than doubles between 2022 and 2050. Annual emissions are
set to decline slightly by 2050, with the majority of the reduction taking place before 2030.
In the APS, clean energy investment more than triple, accounting for over 60% of total energy
investment by 2050. CO2 emissions fall by nearly a third to 1.6 Gt CO2 by 2050. Cutting CO2
emissions is not the only imperative: reducing methane emissions from the regional oil and
gas infrastructure is also a key challenge, and one that is the focus of several policy initiatives.

5.7.2

What’s next for oil and gas exports from Eurasia?

Russia
Russia has continued to export large volumes of oil since its invasion of Ukraine, but the cast
of buyers has changed. Exports that previously went to the European Union and North
America have mostly been redirected to other markets, notably India and China. In our
scenarios, Russian attempts to pivot to Asia and other non-European markets are hampered
in future years by the global peak in oil and gas demand and the long-term effects of
sanctions, which are felt mainly in parts of Russian oil and gas industry that could benefit
most from Western equipment or specialisation. In the case of oil, exports fall by 1 mb/d to
2030 in the STEPS and 2 mb/d in the APS. In the case of natural gas, overall Russian exports
in the STEPS are 40% below pre-invasion levels by 2030. Pipeline exports to Europe fell by
nearly half in 2022; a gradual ramp up of deliveries to China through the Power of Siberia
and Eastern routes is not enough to make up for the lost volumes, and in our scenarios there
is no need for additional pipeline links between Russia and China, given the trajectory of
demand in China. Russia may look to LNG to diversify its supply options, but that is a very
crowded field: around 250 bcm of new projects are under construction, all targeting start-up
between 2025 and 2030. Russia’s share of internationally traded gas, which stood at 30% in
2021, falls to 15% by 2030 in the STEPS and APS. Net income from gas sales falls from around
USD 100 billion in 2021 to less than USD 40 billion in 2030 in all scenarios.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Caspian
The Caspian region is rich in oil and natural gas resources, but for a long time has faced
challenges over how best to transport them to export markets. This traditional challenge has
been resolved, at least in part, with new infrastructure projects linking Azerbaijan, and to
some extent Kazakhstan, to European markets, and Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to markets
in China. In 2022, the Caspian region as a whole exported 2 mb/d of crude oil and oil products
and 70 bcm of natural gas; China has been the major growth market, accounting for 40% of
total exports in 2022 compared with 30% in 2012. But the prospects for further growth, in
all directions, are clouded by complex energy relationships with Russia and by the challenging
commercial case for pipeline projects at a time when the pace of global energy transitions is
picking up. Some parts of the energy infrastructure in the Caspian are also in need of
modernisation and repair, and there are supply chokepoints in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan
that undermine domestic energy security and make exports difficult.
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

233

The projected peak in global oil and gas demand before 2030 in the STEPS raises questions
about the viability of plans to monetise a larger share of the Caspian’s untapped oil and gas
resources in the future. There is some potential for an increase in oil and gas exports to China,
but this is moderated by stagnating demand in China beyond 2030 in both scenarios. There
likewise is some modest potential for further westward Azerbaijani exports as Europe looks
to replace gas previously imported from Russia. Looking further ahead, however, Europe’s
limited need for gas is not well-matched with the long lead times and significant upfront
investment involved in developing new upstream resources and matching large-scale gas
pipelines. A growing and dynamic global LNG market appears well-placed to satisfy
incremental demand growth in both Asia and Europe, and Russian cuts to its pipeline
deliveries to Europe appear to have reinforced importer preferences for the flexibility that
comes with seaborne trade over the rigid politics of pipelines.
There has also been much discussion about other potential market-expanding infrastructure,
such as the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline, or the Trans-Caspian Gas
Pipeline Project linking Turkmen and Azeri gas fields. However, these are hindered by the
complex web of geopolitical and economic interests that need to be reconciled to secure the
permits and the capital necessary to greenlight projects. And Russia looms large in the
background, making use of its substantial infrastructure connections in the region to further
its own political and economic interests.

day (mboe/d) over the period to 2030 in response to robust oil and gas demand in China.
234

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Declining crude exports to Europe after 2030 offset marginal eastward growth, resulting in a
slight contraction in total exports by 2050. In the APS, meeting the climate ambitions
announced by countries around the world reduces the need for around 0.9 mb/d of new
upstream oil projects and around 80 bcm of new gas projects, compared with the STEPS, and
this lowers the level of oil and gas exports by nearly half in 2050. Lower export volumes in
the APS are accompanied by lower oil and gas prices, with the result that net income from
exports in 2050 fall to less than USD 30 billion, around half the level of the STEPS.
The environmental performance of Caspian oil and gas supply is another factor weighing on
its future prospects. Ageing infrastructure and relatively poor maintenance at production
sites at present are causing high levels of loss, and satellites are detecting particularly large
methane leaks from Turkmenistan. Partly as a result of these losses, the emissions intensity
of a barrel of oil in the Caspian is estimated at around 150 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide
per barrel of oil equivalent (kg CO2/boe); for natural gas it is around 120 kg CO2/boe. This
puts the region 40% higher than the global average intensity for oil and nearly double for
natural gas, leaving it at a disadvantage in a world increasingly concerned about the
emissions associated with oil and gas supply (Figure 5.18).

China has shaped trends across many parts of the energy sector in recent years. Its influence
remains strong in all our scenarios but evolves in line with structural changes in its economy
and energy system (see Chapter 1, section 1.2). As things stand, China is by far the largest
producer and consumer of coal, and a major consumer of oil and gas, which makes it the
world’s largest CO2 emitter, accounting for one-third of the global total. Its total CO2
emissions were 12.1 Gt in 2022, the bulk of which stemmed from the use of coal in electricity
generation and industry. But China is also the largest user in the world of many clean energy
technologies, accounting in 2022 for 60% of global sales of electric cars, 50% of wind capacity
additions, 45% of global solar PV capacity additions and 30% of nuclear capacity additions.
Electric cars have already achieved a 29% market share, and clean energy is advancing so
quickly that China is on track to exceed its 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
target of 1 200 GW of solar and wind capacity five years ahead of schedule.
China also dominates many aspects of clean energy technology supply chains. In technology
manufacturing, it is currently the largest producer of solar PV, wind, batteries, heat pumps
and electrolysers for hydrogen production, with plans for further scale up (IEA, 2023e). It also
236

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

produces more aluminium and steel than any other country, and leads the world in the
processing of cobalt, lithium, copper, graphite and rare earths. Mining of critical minerals is
one of the few areas where it does not lead in clean technology supply chains (IEA, 2023f).
China’s 14th Five-year Plan sets the course for its energy sector to 2025, and envisages
continued scaling up of clean energy (Table 5.9). In the STEPS, China’s total CO2 emissions
peak around 2025 and then decline at a pace of about 2.3% per year to 2050, falling to 7 Gt
(Figure 5.19). Despite this, China remains the largest emitter in the world in 2050. But it also
remains the leader in deployment of several clean energy technologies on the back of
average investment in clean energy technologies of well over USD 650 billion per year, and
by 2050 it accounts for half of global solar PV capacity, 40% of wind capacity, one-third of all
nuclear power capacity and 40% of the global electric car fleet. In addition, China is set to be
a leader in electrolytic hydrogen production and heat pump manufacturing.

China is a market mover for all fossil fuels due to the scale of its energy use. In 2022, it was
the world’s largest coal consumer, producer and importer, though its imports decline almost
30% by 2030 in the STEPS, falling behind the level of imports in India. It is also one of the
largest oil consumers in the world, accounting for 15% of global demand in 2022, and oil
imports are projected to increase to 2030. It recently also became the world’s largest natural
gas importer and has contracted large volumes from global LNG markets as well as key
pipeline suppliers, including Russia. Despite growing deployment of clean energy

technologies, China remains the largest consumer of fossil fuels through to 2050 in the STEPS.
Its coal use peaks around 2025, then starts a long-term decline to 50% below the peak by
2050. Natural gas use continues to grow strongly to 2030 before eventually peaking in 2040
at about one-quarter higher than the level today. Oil consumption peaks at 16.6 mb/d before
2030, ending decades of growth, and then declines steadily to 12 mb/d in 2050.
China’s updated NDC targets, which include reaching carbon neutrality before 2060, are fully
reflected in the APS. In this scenario, China’s total CO2 emissions peak before 2025, with
faster progress on energy efficiency, renewables and nuclear power leading to an earlier
peak in coal use, and faster deployment of EVs helping to curb oil demand. The unabated use
of coal is cut by two-thirds by 2040 and almost 90% by 2050. Natural gas use still increases
to 2030 before entering a long-term decline, but less of it is used is all sectors in the APS:
some of the biggest differences are power (about 90 bcm lower in 2050 than in the STEPS),
followed by industry (80 bcm lower), buildings (60 bcm lower) and transport (20 bcm). China
has amassed a considerable portfolio of contracted LNG and pipeline imports in recent years.
With lower demand in the APS, around 80 bcm of a 270 bcm portfolio of contracted gas is
surplus to requirements in 2030. Oil demand in China also peaks earlier in the APS, at
15.9 mb/d in the mid-2020s, and then gradually falls to 6.9 mb/d in 2050.

5.8.2

How soon will coal use peak in China?

The question of when coal use in China will peak is an important one for the global clean
energy transition because China is responsible for such a large share of global coal use. In
2022, China consumed more coal than all other countries combined, and combustion of coal
emitted 8.6 Gt CO2, accounting for about 70% of China’s total emissions and one-quarter of
global energy-related emissions.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

The power sector accounts for over 60% of China’s coal use today (Figure 5.21). Coal
accounted for over 60% of electricity generation in China in 2022. While high, this share of
generation is far below the peak of 81% in 2007 and the average over the last 20 years of
73%. Increasing demand for electricity has nevertheless led to China completing almost
40 GW of new coal capacity on average per year over the past five years, more than the rest
of the world combined in the same period. In 2022, close to 90 GW of new coal-fired capacity
was approved to start construction plus another 50 GW planned, adding to the nearly
100 GW under construction as of the end of the year, indicating that total coal capacity in
China will continue to increase to 2030. However, output from coal-fired power plants in
China peaks around 2025 and declines before 2030 in both the STEPS and APS. This happens
because the average capacity factor of coal plants in China declines to just over 40% in 2030
in the STEPS and 35% in the APS, compared with 53% in 2022, on the basis that China will
gradually use its coal-fired power more to provide flexibility and less to deliver bulk energy,
though there is inevitably some uncertainty about the speed and degree of this shift. After
2030, the pathways for unabated coal-fired generation rapidly diverge, with coal use falling
further and faster in the APS than in the STEPS.

while solar PV capacity grows rapidly and passes 2 500 GW by 2030

The extent to which coal-fired power and related emissions decline in the long run varies by
scenario as it is highly dependent on the ability of renewables growth to outpace overall
demand growth. Central to renewables growth is the ability to continue scaling up solar PV
and wind deployment in China. Manufacturing capacity, particularly for solar PV, creates a
huge opportunity to do so (see Chapter 1). In the APS, solar PV installed capacity nears
5 400 GW by 2030. It could go even faster, though successfully integrating more solar PV
requires overcoming a number of challenges: the electricity system has to be equipped to
integrate solar PV and wind output in full, and that requires expansion of electricity

transmission, modernisation of distribution grids, storage technologies and a number of
operational changes.
Coal use in the industry sector has been increasing rapidly since the turn of the millennium.
It accounted for 45% of industrial total consumption of energy in 2022 and was responsible
for 30% of total coal consumption in China. The iron and steel sub-sector is the largest
industrial coal user today, consuming more than 500 Mtce of the total 970 Mtce used by
industry in China. Almost 90% of its steel is produced in integrated blast furnace basic oxygen
furnace (BF-BOF) steel plants where coking coal is used both as reagent to transform iron ore
into iron and as a fuel to heat iron to its melting point (more than 1 500 °C). Iron and steel
coal use peaked in 2014 and declines from 2022 in both the STEPS and APS as scrap becomes
more widely available for secondary production, which is much less energy-intensive and
uses electric arc furnaces to provide heat rather than coal (Figure 5.22). Coal use is also
widespread in other heavy industries, from cement to chemicals, as well as in light industries.
Strategies to switch away from coal in industry sectors are explored in Chapter 3 of Coal in
Net Zero Transitions (IEA, 2022b).
Because coal combustion in China accounts for around one-quarter of total energy-related
CO2 emissions, cuts in its coal use have a major impact on the global outlook for emissions.
In the APS, CO2 emissions from coal combustion in China decline from 8.6 Gt in 2022 to 1.1 Gt
in 2050. This covers 30% of the global CO2 emissions reductions that are needed in this
scenario to meet the emissions reduction targets announced by countries all around the
world. While this would be a significant achievement, much more needs to be done in China
and other countries to enable a faster transition away from unabated fossil fuels use if the
world is to achieve global net zero emissions by 2050.

Through much of its modern history, India has worked to build power generation and refining
capacity, provide affordable access to energy and ensure security of supply. A lot has been
achieved in the past few decades. Since 2000, India has brought electricity to 810 million
people, larger than the population of the European Union and the United States combined.
India has also brought clean cooking access to 655 million people over the same period,
although 430 million people continue to live in households that use traditional biomass
today. Over the past five years, solar PV has accounted for nearly 60% of new generation
capacity. India has had the single largest light-emitting diode (LED) adoption campaign in the
world, with around 370 million LEDs distributed through the UJALA scheme by 2023. India
has also achieved self-sufficiency in petroleum refining capacity despite being a net crude oil
importer, although certain petroleum products continue to be imported.
India is moving into a dynamic new phase in its energy development marked by a long-term
net zero emissions ambition, increased regulatory sophistication, a focus on clean energy
deployment, and the creation of domestic clean energy technology supply chains.
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

Recognising the potential to transform its energy sector and reduce the import burden of
fossil fuels while reducing CO2 emissions, India has announced a net zero emissions target by
2070, and has put in place policies to scale up clean energy supply and clean technology
manufacturing. While clean energy investment in India more than doubles in the STEPS by
2030 from around USD 60 billion in 2022, investment needs to nearly triple by the end of this
decade to be on a trajectory to meet its net zero emissions target, which is reflected in the
APS (Figure 5.23).
In the STEPS, India sees the largest energy demand growth of any country or region in the
world over the next three decades. Although India’s population growth has slowed to reach
replacement levels, its urban population increases by 74% and per capita income triples by
2050. Industrial output expands rapidly, for example through a tripling of output of iron and
steel, and doubling of cement, plus there is a ninefold increase in residential air conditioner
ownership by 2050. As a result, demand for oil and natural gas increases in the STEPS by
nearly 70% between 2022 and 2050, while coal demand increases by 10%, even as solar PV
makes inroads into electricity generation. As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions still rise
nearly 30% by 2050, which is one of the largest increases in the world.
In the APS, the increase in clean energy investment changes the outlook. In the STEPS, solar
provides nearly 45% of total generated power by 2050; in the APS, it crosses 50%. In both
the STEPS and APS, India achieves its target of 50% non-fossil power generation capacity by
2030. Clean energy investment in the APS over and above those in the STEPS also drives
faster growth in electromobility, low-emissions hydrogen, grid expansions and other clean
energy infrastructure. As a result, India’s annual CO2 emissions fall sharply in the APS by over
40% from current levels by 2050, even though its GDP quadruples over this period.

Impact of air conditioners on electricity demand in India

Over the past five decades, India has witnessed over 700 heat wave events, which have
claimed over 17 000 lives (Ray et al., 2021). Fuelled by its geographic and meteorological
conditions, air conditioner ownership in India has been steadily rising with growing incomes,
tripling since 2010 to reach 24 units per 100 households. The impact of cooling needs on
electricity consumption is already clear. Electricity demand is sensitive to temperatures, and
in India’s case there is a sharp increase in demand as temperatures cross the 25 °C threshold
(Figure 5.24). Electricity consumption due to space cooling increased 21% between 2019 and
2022, and today nearly 10% of electricity demand comes from space cooling requirements.

Electricity demand rises sharply with temperatures above 25 °C;

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Household air conditioner ownership is estimated to expand ninefold by 2050 across the IEA
scenarios, outpacing the growth in ownership of every other major household appliance
including televisions, refrigerators and washing machines (Figure 5.25). Residential
electricity demand from cooling increases ninefold in the STEPS by 2050. By 2050, India’s
total electricity demand from residential air conditioners in the STEPS exceeds total
electricity consumption in the whole of Africa today. In the APS, however, electricity demand
for air conditioners is nearly 15% lower in 2050 as it is in the STEPS as a result of increased
use of energy-efficient air conditioners and thermal insulation in buildings. This reduction
itself is larger than the total electricity generation by several countries today, such as that of
the Netherlands.

Air conditioners are projected to be the fastest growing household appliance,
which drives half of the growth in peak electricity demand to 2030 in the STEPS

The growth in ownership and use of air conditioners and other cooling equipment is also one
of the key drivers of the increase in peak electricity demand in India. In the STEPS, peak
electricity demand rises around 60% from the 2022 level by 2030 and cooling accounts for
nearly half of this increase. In the APS, however, the implementation of building codes, the
use of more efficient appliances and the adoption of demand response measures enable the
same cooling needs to be met with less energy. This reduces peak electricity demand growth
by nearly one-quarter compared to the STEPS. Given that the electricity system is sized to
meet peak demand, lower peak demand helps to lower electricity investment needs and
system costs. Although solar PV matches well with daytime cooling needs, cooling demand
is also significant in India during the late evening and at night. Lowering cooling demand
through energy efficiency policies therefore reduces the need for investment in batteries or
expensive standby generation capacity, and thus helps to integrate renewables more cost
effectively.

5.9.3

Will domestic solar PV module manufacturing keep pace with solar
capacity growth in India?

India has historically been a net importer of fossil fuels, and it has now become an importer
of modern clean energy technologies as it scales up solar and wind power generation
capacity. For example, its imports of solar PV modules in 2021-2022 were valued at
USD 3.4 billion (MCI, 2023). Recognising this import dependence and mindful of the high
levels of concentration in clean energy technology supply chains, the national government

244

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

launched the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) programme in 2020 to support domestic
manufacturing in a range of critical sectors, including solar PV modules and advanced
chemistry cell battery manufacturing.
The PLI programme for solar PV module manufacturing budgeted nearly USD 2.5 billion in
subsidies with the aim of creating 65 GW per year of new manufacturing capacity.
Manufacturing companies were selected in two tranches in 2023 and a total of 48 GW of
new capacity was deemed eligible for subsidy awards once manufacturing begins. These new
production lines are expected to come online within two to three years.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: PLI-1 and PLI-2 refer to the two tranches of the Production Linked Incentives programme under which
solar manufacturers were selected to receive subsidies in lieu of creating new manufacturing capacity.

India is expected to meet its 2030 target to have half of its electricity capacity be non-fossil
well before the end of the decade. If the new solar PV module manufacturing capacity under
the PLI programme comes fully online by 2026, it would progress the solar PV module
manufacturing capacity in India to well over what is needed until the end of this decade not
just in the STEPS but also in the APS (Figure 5.26). Solar PV module imports could continue
for a few years because developers will source the cheapest panels available, because the
capacity utilisation factor remains lower than the nameplate capacity, and because there are
lags between the nameplate capacity coming online and the panels being manufactured,
shipped and installed. Nonetheless, as domestic production ramps up, solar PV module
imports will decline and it will help to establish India as a reliable exporter.

Japan and Korea continue to map out secure pathways to reach net zero emissions pledges
by 2050, but it remains challenging to decarbonise large industrial economies that have
historically relied heavily on imported fossil fuels.
In the STEPS, the share of coal and natural gas in the power mix of the two countries –
currently at 65% – falls sharply over the next few decades as Japan’s Green Transformation
policy and Korea’s Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply and Demand dramatically
increase the share of low-emissions fuels in generation, including solar PV, wind and nuclear.
The share of generation from low-emissions technologies of both countries combined rises
from 30% today to around 85% by 2050 in the STEPS. Natural gas demand almost halves by
mid-century, with remaining widespread use in the power, building and industrial sectors,
while coal use declines by two-thirds, largely in industry (Figure 5.27). Reduced oil demand
is shaped by increased adoption of zero emissions vehicles (ZEV), sales of which rise sharply
as government support schemes in both countries incentivise their uptake: ZEVs account for

246

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

65% of new vehicles sold by 2050, bringing oil demand down from nearly 6 mb/d today to
less than 4 mb/d by 2050.
The APS incorporates the pledges stated by Japan and Korea to reach climate neutrality by
2050. Japan’s Green Growth Strategy and Korea’s Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth Act
envisage full decarbonisation of the power sector. Japan also aims for all new cars and vans
sold to be either battery electric, plug-in hybrid, hybrid or fuel cell vehicles, with a target date
of 2035 for cars and 2040 for vans. Korea has set a target for more than 80% of car sales to
be low-emissions vehicles by 2030. Both countries have also introduced guidelines for new
buildings to meet zero-carbon standards by the end of this decade. As a result, investment
in clean energy technologies in the APS rapidly scales up to over USD 175 billion by 2050.

Japan and Korea both have small land areas relative to the size of their populations and
industrial sectors: this is a disadvantage when it comes to deploying renewables such as solar
PV and onshore wind. Their distinct geographical settings require the two countries to
explore a diversified mix of clean technologies which includes major roles for imported lowemissions hydrogen and hydrogen-rich fuels, floating offshore wind and nuclear.

5.10.2 Challenges and opportunities of nuclear and offshore wind
Both Korea and Japan need to determine their specific path and mix of technologies to
achieve secure clean energy transitions. In the power sector, both countries have been
investing in solar PV, which expanded significantly between 2010 and 2022. Today, however,
fossil fuels still account for two-thirds of power generation in both countries, mainly from
coal and natural gas. Further acceleration of efforts on clean electricity generation is
necessary to achieve their goals for clean energy transitions. Nuclear power and offshore
wind have the potential to make a significant contribution to decarbonising the power sector,
and in our scenarios their role in electricity generation rises rapidly (Figure 5.28). The share
of nuclear power in electricity generation in Japan and Korea increases by 75% in both STEPS
and APS by 2050. Maintaining effective and efficient safety regulations is clearly essential in
this context.

Japan and Korea totals only 0.3 GW today, due largely to a lack of transmission capacity and
the high cost of facilities. The unique geographical characteristics of Korea and Japan add to
the challenges: the sea surrounding both countries is more than 50 metres deep in many
places and has steep slopes which make it impossible to deploy traditional seabed-mounted
offshore wind installations. Technological development and cost reductions in floating
systems could accelerate expansion of offshore wind, which is in the early deployment stage
today. Government support is planned, as accelerating the full-scale roll-out of floating
248

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

systems requires extensive funding for R&D and for efforts to de-risk investment in early
projects. Policies for offshore wind in Japan and Korea aim to tackle the challenges by
simplifying project approval processes, building resilient supply chains and developing
efficient low cost structures that can adapt to the particular geographical and climatic
environment. In the STEPS, combined for Japan and Korea offshore wind increases its
contribution to generation from less than 0.1% today to 15% by 2050. In the APS, its
contribution in electricity generation increases to 20%, which reaches the share of solar PV,
and offshore wind and nuclear together account for nearly 45% of total generation by 2050
in the APS.

5.10.3 What role can hydrogen play in the energy mix and how can the
governments deploy it?
In the APS, Japan and Korea import significant quantities of hydrogen and hydrogen-based
fuels for use in the power sector and for direct use in industry. By 2050, Korea and Japan
account for almost 40% of global hydrogen imports (Figure 5.29).

and hydrogen-based fuels after the European Union

Today Japan and Korea’s share of hydrogen in total final consumption is close to 0%. It is
mainly produced through natural gas reforming and consumed in oil refineries. Both
governments aim to expand its use in coming decades with 20% ammonia co-firing by 2030
(50% by 2035 in Japan) to reduce the carbon intensity of the existing coal-fired fleet. After
the power sector, demand for hydrogen will be driven by hard-to-abate sectors such as longdistance trucking, aviation, shipping and heavy industry (Figure 5.30). In aviation and

shipping, demand is likely to be focussed on synthetic kerosene and ammonia. By 2050,
hydrogen accounts for 2% of total final consumption in the STEPS and up to 9% in the APS.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Notes: Transformation includes co-firing in power generation, hydrogen as an input to hydrogen-based fuels
and use in biofuel production. Imported hydrogen includes hydrogen from cracking of imported ammonia,
imports of liquefied hydrogen and synthetic oil products. By-product refers to hydrogen produced in naphtha
reformers in refineries and petrochemical facilities.

While unabated fossil fuel-based hydrogen meets most existing demand today, Japan and
Korea are looking for low-emissions hydrogen supply to meet new demand and replace
existing unabated production capacities. In the APS, hydrogen produced from electrolysis
ramps up significantly, accounting for nearly three-quarters of domestic production in the
two countries in 2050. To help develop and secure the low-emissions hydrogen that they
need, Japan and Korea are actively seeking partnerships with potential exporting countries
and technology providers. Long-term investment and contracts are required across hydrogen
value chains, from upstream (fertilisers and providers of renewable electricity, electrolysers
and CO2 capture) to transportation and storage (including ships, ports and plants to convert
different hydrogen commodities). Progress is being made in creating reliable demand, but
more needs to be done on that front to support long-distance transport and industrial uses
where off-take risks are hindering the adoption of new equipment and processes. The
development of international standards, certification arrangements and emissions
accounting frameworks all could help the scaling up that is needed and to assist governments
to achieve emissions reduction target through the use of imported hydrogen.

Southeast Asia is home to nearly 9% of the world population and accounts for 6% of global
GDP. It is a major engine of economic growth and has an outsized influence in global energy.
The collective GDP of countries in Southeast Asia has nearly tripled since 2000, outpacing
growth in global GDP over this period. As a result, energy demand growth in the region has
also outpaced the global average, and that is set to continue: in the STEPS, the region
experiences the second-highest energy demand growth in the world after India until 2050,
driven by an increasing population, rising standards of living and rapid urbanisation.
As a result of its continued reliance on fossil fuels, Southeast Asia also sees the largest
absolute growth of CO2 emissions of any region in the world. Its emissions increase by 46%
from 2022 levels by 2050 in the STEPS, with coal responsible for much of the rise. Southeast
Asia is one of the few regions in the world where electricity generation from coal increases
in the STEPS through to 2050. While the share of coal in power generation falls to less than
one-third by 2050 in the STEPS, it is still the second-highest of any region in the world by
2050.

Today Southeast Asia relies heavily on coal for electricity generation. Two ambitious Just
Energy Transitions Partnerships (JETP) were established in Southeast Asia in 2022, one with
Indonesia and another with Viet Nam. The partnerships promise better access to
international financing to accelerate transitions away from unabated coal-fired power to
help reduce emissions. In Viet Nam, the latest power development plan seeks to reshape its
energy system, including by moving away from unabated coal use and by scaling up the use
of low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia in the power sector.

Southeast Asia has emerged as a global hub for clean energy technology manufacturing, with
Viet Nam and Indonesia joining the ranks of exporters of equipment such as solar PV
modules. However, the race to build industrial capacity risks leading to rapid development
of captive coal projects, such as for nickel processing in Indonesia. Overall, clean energy
investment in the region was nearly USD 30 billion in 2022, which looks to more than double
by the end of this decade. Nevertheless, there is more to do to be on track to deliver longer
term ambitions as reflected in the APS. For this to happen, clean energy investment needs
to nearly quadruple by 2030 and continue rising afterwards. Investment on this scale in the
APS leads to solar power increasing almost sixfold by 2030 and to coal-fired power
generation halving by 2050 from 2022 levels, reducing overall CO2 emissions by over 40%,
even as the region’s economy grows by well over two-and-half-times larger.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

5.11.2 How can international finance accelerate clean energy transitions
in Southeast Asia?
Marshalling the necessary finance to fulfil clean energy transition objectives can be
challenging for emerging market and developing economies as they tend to rely heavily on
public investment by governments or state-owned enterprises. They face relatively high
borrowing costs, and stepping up investment calls for multiple sources of finance: both
domestic and international private finance have pivotal roles to play. Mobilising this capital
requires international co-operation, involvement of international and development finance
institutions, and reforms to domestic policy and regulatory frameworks that facilitate private
investment.
Just Energy Transition Partnerships, launched at COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, attempt to
address this challenge. They are a financing co-operation mechanism between advanced
economies and a coal-dependent emerging market and developing economy which commits
to ambitious emissions reduction targets and defines a credible national transition pathway.
The JETP framework includes multilateral development banks, national development banks
and private lenders. The aim is to make available a mix of financing, some at concessional
terms, with the goal of mobilising more resources by catalysing international private
investment.
The JETP between Indonesia and the International Partners Group (IPG) – which includes
Canada, Denmark, European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom
and United States – was developed to help Indonesia get on track to bring emissions to net
zero by 2060. The JETP helped strengthen Indonesia’s ambitions, bringing its pledges in line
with the milestones set out in the Energy Sector Roadmap to Net Zero Emissions in Indonesia
(IEA, 2022c), which was prepared in co-operation with the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources. Putting the economy on a trajectory consistent with reaching net zero
emissions by 2060 necessitates more than doubling total annual investment in the energy
sector by 2030, raising the share of renewables in the power sector to one-third by 2030
(Figure 5.32). It also means power sector emissions peaking at no more than 290 Mt in 2030,
and unabated coal-fired electricity generation peaking at around the same time.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In pursuit of these objectives, the Indonesia JETP aims to secure an initial USD 20 billion in
financing over three to five years from both public and private sources. USD 10 billion
consists of public sector finance backed by the International Partners Group, with the
remainder to be obtained through a combination of market-rate loans and private
investment. Another objective of the partnership is to help Indonesia update its technical
and regulatory frameworks in order to overcome barriers to investment, facilitate the
deployment of support and mobilise further domestic and international capital to speed up
the transition to net zero emissions.
The JETP between Viet Nam and the IPG was developed to support the country in pursuit of
its target to reach net zero emissions by 2050. It reflects its ambition to accelerate its
transition to a carbon neutral energy system, including its intention to bring about a peak in
Chapter 5 | Regional insights

emissions by 2030, to cease issuing permits for the construction of new coal-fired power
plants, to promote the development of renewables and to improve energy efficiency, while
ensuring energy remains secure and affordable. The Viet Nam JETP aims to mobilise at least
USD 15.5 billion over the next five years. Half of this, nearly USD 8 billion, will be public sector
finance backed by the IPG. As with Indonesia, the aim is for international funding to help
catalyse additional private sector finance that at least matches the level of public sector
finance, and to help Viet Nam attract the capital it needs as its clean energy transition moves
forward.

To get on track for net zero emissions by 2060 and meet the JETP target to peak emissions
in the power sector by 2030, total annual energy investment needs to double by 2030

Viet Nam’s Power Development Plan (PDP) 8, approved in May 2022, sets out its increased
ambition and details a pathway for power sector development to 2030. It also includes a
longer term vision to 2050. In line with JETP commitments, coal-fired capacity is planned to
peak at about 30 GW in 2030, down from 55 GW in the previous PDP. Beyond 2030, coal
plants would have to close when they are 40 years old unless converted to run on ammonia
or biomass. Significantly raising the share of variable renewables in the electricity mix is
another key component of the plan, and is accompanied by a recognition that substantial
investment in grids is needed to make this work. Offshore wind is planned to play an
important role, reflecting the fact that Viet Nam is home to some of the best offshore wind
resources in Southeast Asia.

5.11.3 How can regional integration help integrate more renewables?
Clean energy transitions in Southeast Asia, supported by the JETP programme, will reshape
power systems and help to strengthen energy security. Establishing markets and
254

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

mechanisms for renewables deployment, scaling up clean energy investment and limiting
coal-fired power will be crucial in the period to 2030. Integrating rising wind and solar PV
capacity into electricity systems will become an increasingly central task after 2030, as their
share of the overall generation mix rises from 20% in 2030 to over 50% in 2050 in the APS,
compared with just 5% in 2022 (Figure 5.33).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Enhanced regional integration through strengthened electricity grids can improve electricity
security and aid renewables integration in Southeast Asia in several ways. Flexibility needs
can be reduced through regional integration by enabling electricity demand to be balanced
over larger areas, which tends to smooth out variability and can moderate peak loads.
Flexibility needs can also be reduced by linking systems that rely on wind and solar PV to
varying degrees and that have different production profiles. Regional integration can also
boost the available supply of flexibility by facilitating the pooling of a wider set of resources,
including hydropower, fossil fuel-based capacity and energy storage. Better integrated
systems could also mitigate the risk of outages and increase system resilience.
Regional integration requires the scaling up of investment in electricity grids, including in
interconnections between countries. In Southeast Asia, grid investment rises from around
USD 10 billion in 2022 to USD 16 billion in 2030 and USD 40 billion in 2050 in the APS. There
is already growing momentum for increasing regional integration of the electricity network
in Southeast Asia. Programmes such as the ASEAN Power Grid have boosted collaboration
between countries and brought greater awareness of the advantages of integration for the
region.

Definitional note: Energy supply and transformation tables
Total energy supply (TES) is equivalent to electricity and heat generation plus the other
energy sector, excluding electricity, heat and hydrogen, plus total final consumption,
excluding electricity, heat and hydrogen. TES does not include ambient heat from heat
pumps or electricity trade. Solar in TES includes solar PV generation, concentrating solar
power (CSP) and final consumption of solar thermal. Biofuels conversion losses are the
conversion losses to produce biofuels (mainly from modern solid bioenergy) used in the
energy sector. Low‐emissions hydrogen production is merchant low‐emissions hydrogen
production (excluding onsite production at industrial facilities and refineries), with inputs
referring to total fuel inputs and outputs to produce hydrogen. While not itemised
260

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

separately, geothermal and marine (tidal and wave) energy are included in the renewables
category of TES and electricity and heat sectors. While not itemised separately, nonrenewable waste and other sources are included in TES.

Definitional note: Energy demand tables
Sectors comprising total final consumption (TFC) include industry (energy use and feedstock),
transport and buildings (residential, services and non-specified other). While not itemised
separately, agriculture and other non-energy use are included in TFC. While not itemised
separately, non-renewable waste, solar thermal and geothermal energy are included in
buildings, industry and TFC. Aviation and shipping include both domestic and international
energy demand. Energy demand from international marine and aviation bunkers are
included in global transport totals and TFC.

Definitional note: Fossil fuel production and demand tables
Oil production and demand is expressed in million barrels per day (mb/d). Tight oil includes
tight crude oil and condensate production except for the United States, which includes tight
crude oil only (US tight condensate volumes are included in natural gas liquids). Processing
gains cover volume increases that occur during crude oil refining. Biofuels and their inclusion
in liquids demand is expressed in energy-equivalent volumes of gasoline and diesel. Natural
gas production and demand is expressed in billion cubic metres (bcm). Coal production and
demand is expressed in million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce). Differences between
historical production and demand volumes for oil, gas and coal are due to changes in stocks.
Bunkers include both international marine and aviation fuels. Refining capacity at risk is
defined as the difference between refinery capacity and refinery runs, with the latter
including a 14% allowance for downtime. Projected shutdowns beyond those publicly
announced are also counted as capacity at risk.

Definitional note: Electricity tables

IEA. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Electricity generation expressed in terawatt-hours (TWh) and installed electrical capacity
data expressed in gigawatts (GW) are both provided on a gross basis, i.e. includes own use
by the generator. Projected gross electrical capacity is the sum of existing capacity and
additions, less retirements. While not itemised separately, other sources are included in total
electricity generation. Hydrogen and ammonia are fuels that can provide a low-emissions
alternative to natural gas- and coal-fired electricity generation – either through co-firing or
full conversion of facilities. Blending levels of hydrogen in gas-fired plants and ammonia in
coal-fired plants are represented in the scenarios and reported in the tables. The electricity
generation outputs in the tables are based on fuel input shares, while the hydrogen and
ammonia capacity is derived based on a typical capacity factor.

Definitional note: CO2 emissions tables
Total CO2 includes carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and
non-renewable wastes; from industrial and fuel transformation processes (process

emissions); and from flaring and CO2 removal. CO2 removal includes: captured and stored
emissions from the combustion of bioenergy and renewable wastes; from biofuels
production; and from direct air capture. Aviation and shipping include both domestic and
international emissions.
The first two entries are often reported as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage
(BECCS). Note that some of the CO2 captured from biofuels production and direct air capture
is used to produce synthetic fuels, which is not included as CO2 removal.
Total CO2 captured includes the carbon dioxide captured from CCUS facilities, such as
electricity generation or industry, and atmospheric CO2 captured through direct air capture,
but excludes that captured and used for urea production.

Definitional note: Economic and activity indicators
The emissions intensity expressed in grammes of carbon dioxide per kilowatt‐hour (g CO2 per
kWh) is calculated based on electricity‐only plants and the electricity component of
combined heat and power (CHP) plants. 1 Primary chemicals include ethylene, propylene,
aromatics, methanol and ammonia. Industrial production data for aluminium excludes
production based on internally generated scrap. Heavy-duty trucks activity includes freight
activity of medium freight trucks and heavy freight trucks. Aviation activity includes both
domestic and international flight activity. Shipping activity refers to international shipping
activity.
Abbreviations used include: GDP = gross domestic product; GJ = gigajoule; m2 = square
metres; Mt = million tonnes; pkm = passenger‐kilometres; PPP = purchasing power parity;
tkm = tonnes‐kilometres.

Definitional note: Hydrogen tables

IEA. CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Total hydrogen demand includes merchant (or offsite) hydrogen demand and hydrogen
demand in industry and refineries covered by onsite production. It also includes hydrogen
used in the production of hydrogen-based fuels (ammonia, synthetic hydrocarbon fuels). The
hydrogen balance table A.28 is expressed in million tonnes of hydrogen equivalent, which
means for hydrogen-based fuels the equivalent mass of hydrogen that would contain the
energy content of these fuels. Hydrogen demand in end-use sectors includes total final
consumption of hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels as well as hydrogen demand in industry
covered by onsite production within industrial facilities. Low-emissions hydrogen trade as a
share of production represents the percentage of produced low-emissions hydrogen
(including merchant hydrogen and that which is produced onsite in industry and refining)
which is exported from the region as hydrogen or as an energy product.

To derive the associated electricity‐only emissions from CHP plants, we assume that the heat production of
a CHP plant is 90% efficient and the remainder of the fuel input is allocated to electricity generation.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Annex B
Design of the scenarios

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The World Energy Outlook-2023 (WEO-2023) explores three main scenarios in the analysis in
the chapters. These scenarios are not predictions – the IEA does not have a single view on
the future of the energy system. The scenarios are:


The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) is designed to provide a sense of the prevailing
direction of energy system progression, based on a detailed review of the current policy
landscape. It explores how energy systems evolve under current policies and private
sector momentum without additional policy implementation. The scenario is not
developed with a particular outcome in mind, but rather aims to hold a mirror up to
policy makers to understand where current efforts are likely to lead global energy
systems. The STEPS does not take for granted that all government targets will be
achieved. Instead, it takes a granular, sector-by-sector look at existing policies and
measures, as of late August 2023. New this year, the STEPS takes into account industry
action, including manufacturing capacity of clean energy technologies, and its impacts
on market uptake beyond the policies in place or announced. A snapshot of the major
policies considered in the STEPS is presented in Tables B.6 to B.11.



The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that governments will meet, in full and
on time, the climate commitments they have made, including their Nationally
Determined Contributions and longer-term net zero emissions targets. As with the
STEPS, the APS is not designed to achieve a particular outcome, but instead provides a
bottom-up assessment of how countries may deliver on climate pledges. Countries
without ambitious long-term pledges are assumed to benefit in this scenario from the
accelerated cost reductions and wider availability of clean energy technologies. The list
of additional climate and energy targets met in the APS is presented in Tables B.6 to
B.11. All net zero emissions pledges considered in the APS are included in the IEA Climate
Pledges Explorer. 1



The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario depicts a narrow but achievable
pathway for the global energy sector to reach net zero energy-related CO2 emissions by
2050 by deploying a wide portfolio of clean energy technologies and without offsets
from land-use measures. It recognises that achieving net zero energy sector CO2
emissions by 2050 depends on fair and effective global co-operation, with advanced
economies taking the lead and reaching net zero emissions earlier in the NZE Scenario
than emerging market and developing economies. This scenario also achieves universal
energy access by 2030, consistent with the energy-related targets of the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals. The NZE Scenario is consistent with limiting the global
temperature rise to 1.5 °C (with at least a 50% probability) with limited overshoot.



Population is a major determinant of many of the trends in the Outlook. We use the
medium variant of the United Nations projections as the basis for population growth in
all scenarios, but this is naturally subject to a degree of uncertainty.



On average, the rate of population growth is assumed to slow over time, but the global
population approaches 9.7 billion by 2050 (Table B.1).



Around three-fifths of the increase over the projection period to 2050 is in Africa and
around a further quarter is in the Asia Pacific region.



The share of the world’s population living in towns and cities has been rising steadily, a
trend that is projected to continue over the period to 2050. In aggregate, this means
that virtually all of the 1.7 billion increase in global population over the period is added
to cities and towns.



There are 73 direct carbon pricing instruments in place today, covering around
40 countries and over 30 subnational jurisdictions. Global carbon pricing revenues in
2022 increased by over 10% from 2021 levels, to around USD 95 billion (World Bank,
2023b).



Existing and scheduled CO2 pricing schemes are reflected in the STEPS, covering
electricity generation, industry, energy production sectors and other end-use sectors,
e.g. aviation, road transport and buildings, where applicable.



In the APS, higher CO2 prices are introduced across all regions with net zero emissions
pledges. No explicit pricing is assumed in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa)
and Other Asia regions. Instead, these regions rely on direct policy interventions to drive
decarbonisation in the APS.



In the NZE Scenario, CO2 prices cover all regions and rise rapidly across all advanced
economies as well as in prominent emerging market economies with net zero emissions
pledges, including China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa. CO2 prices are lower,
but nevertheless rising in other emerging market and developing economies such as

Annex B | Design of the scenarios

297

B

North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia). CO2 prices
are lower in the remaining developing economies, as it is assumed they pursue more
direct policies to adapt and transform their energy systems.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.



298

All scenarios consider the effects of other policy measures alongside CO2 pricing, such
as coal phase-out plans, efficiency standards and renewable targets (Tables B.6 - B.11).
These policies interact with carbon pricing; therefore, CO2 pricing is not the marginal
cost of abatement as it is often the case in other modelling approaches.



The World Energy Outlook supply modelling relies on estimates of the remaining
technically recoverable resource, rather than the (often more widely quoted) numbers
for proven reserves. Resource estimates are subject to a considerable degree of
uncertainty, as well as the distinction in the analysis between conventional and
unconventional resource types.



Overall, the remaining technical recoverable resources of fossil fuels remain similar to
the World Energy Outlook-2022. All fuels are at a level comfortably sufficient to meet
the projections of global energy demand growth to 2050 in all scenarios. Remaining
technically recoverable resources of US tight oil (crude plus condensate) total more than
200 billion barrels.



Overall, the gradual depletion of resources (at a pace that varies by scenario) means that
operators have to develop more difficult and complex reservoirs. This tends to push up
production costs over time, although this effect is offset by the assumed continuous
adoption of new, more efficient production technologies and practices.



World coal resources are made up of various types of coal: around 80% is steam and
coking coal and the remainder is lignite. Coal resources are more available in parts of
the world without substantial natural gas and oil resources, notably in Asia.



All costs are expressed in year-2022 dollars.



Major contributors to the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) include: overnight capital
costs; capacity factor that describes the average output over the year relative to the
maximum rated capacity (typical values provided); cost of fuel inputs; plus operation
and maintenance. Economic lifetime assumptions are 25 years for solar PV, and onshore
and offshore wind.



Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) assumptions reflect market data and survey
information provided through the Cost of Capital Observatory (IEA, 2023), updated
analysis for utility-scale solar PV in the World Energy Outlook-2020 (IEA, 2020), with a
range of 4-7%, and for offshore wind analysis from the Offshore Wind Outlook 2019 (IEA,
2019), with a range of 5-8%. Onshore wind was assumed to have the same WACC as
utility-scale solar PV. A standard WACC was assumed for nuclear power, coal-fired and
gas-fired power plants (8-9% based on the stage of economic development).



The value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE) incorporates information on
both costs and the value provided to the system. Based on the LCOE, estimates of
energy, capacity and flexibility value are incorporated to provide a more complete
metric of competitiveness for power generation technologies.



Fuel, CO2 and operation and maintenance costs reflect the average over the ten years
following the indicated date in the projections (and therefore vary by scenario in 2022).



Solar PV and wind costs do not include the cost of energy storage technologies, such as
utility-scale batteries.



The capital costs for nuclear power represent the “nth-of-a-kind” costs for new reactor
designs, with substantial cost reductions from the first-of-a-kind projects.



All costs represent fully installed/delivered technologies, not solely the module cost,
unless otherwise noted. Installed/delivered costs include engineering, procurement and
construction costs to install the module.



Iron-based steel production costs display a range considering technology and regional
differences and differentiate between conventional and innovative production routes.
Conventional routes are blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) and direct reduced
iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF). The innovative routes are innovative smelting
reduction with carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), DRI-EAF with CCUS, 100%
electrolytic hydrogen-based DRI-EAF and iron ore electrolysis.



Vehicle costs reflect production costs, not retail prices, to better reflect the cost declines
in total cost of manufacturing, which move independently of final market prices for
electric vehicles to customers.



Electrolyser costs reflect a weighted average among different electrolysis technologies.
The lower value for hydrogen electrolysers refers to China and the upper one to the rest
of the world.



Fuel cell costs are based on stack manufacturing costs only, not installed/delivered
costs. The costs provided are for automotive fuel cell stacks for light-duty vehicles.



Utility-scale stationary battery costs reflect the average installed costs of all battery
systems rated to provide maximum power output for a four-hour period.

Policies

The policy actions assumed to be taken by governments are key variables in this World
Energy Outlook (WEO). An overview of the policies and measures that are considered in the
various scenarios is included in Tables B.6 to B.11. The tables do not include all policies and
measures, but rather highlight the policies most prominent in shaping global energy demand
today, while being derived from an exhaustive examination of announcements and plans in
countries around the world.
The tables begin with broad cross-cutting policy frameworks, followed by more detailed
policies by sector: power, industry, buildings and transport. The tables highlight policies and
targets for both the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Announced Pledges Scenario
(APS). For the STEPS, the tables list both new policies enacted, implemented or revised since
the publication of the WEO-2022, as well as significant established long-term policies that
have a major influence on the outcomes in the STEPS. It does not take for granted that all
government targets will be reached. Targets that are achieved or surpassed in the STEPS are
listed, indicating the most recent IEA assessment that concrete implementation plans are
able to deliver on the targets.
For the APS, targets not realised in the STEPS and announced policies to achieve these targets
are listed. It indicates additional policy efforts to realise them. The APS assumes all policies
included in the STEPS to remain in force.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Some regional policies have been included in the tables if they play a significant role in
shaping the energy landscape at a global scale, e.g. regional carbon markets, efficiency
standards in very large provinces or states. This World Energy Outlook, for the first time,
includes various industry-led targets for energy and climate, presented in Table B.11. A more
comprehensive list of energy-related policies by country can be viewed on the IEA Policies
and Measures Database at: http://www.iea.org/policies.

Note: There is no generally accepted definition of barrel of oil equivalent (boe); typically the conversion factors
used vary from 7.15 to 7.40 boe per tonne of oil equivalent. Natural gas is attributed a low heating value of
1 MJ per 44.1 kg. Conversions to and from billion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent (bcme) are given as
representative multipliers but may differ from the average values obtained by converting natural gas volumes
between IEA balances due to the use of country-specific energy densities. Lower heating values (LHV) are used
throughout.

Definitions
Advanced bioenergy: Sustainable fuels produced from wastes, residues and non-food crop
feedstocks (excluding traditional uses of biomass), which are capable of delivering significant
life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings compared with fossil fuel alternatives and of
minimising adverse sustainability impacts. Advanced bioenergy feedstocks either do not
directly compete with food and feed crops for agricultural land or are only developed on land
previously used to produced food crop feedstocks for biofuels.
Agriculture: Includes all energy used on farms, in forestry and for fishing.
Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions: Includes greenhouse gas
emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use.
Ammonia (NH3): Is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen. It can be used as a feedstock in
the chemical sector, as a fuel in direct combustion processes in fuel cells, and as a hydrogen
carrier. To be considered a low-emissions fuel, ammonia must be produced from hydrogen
in which the electricity used to produce the hydrogen is generated from low-emissions
generation sources. Produced in such a way, ammonia is considered a low-emissions
hydrogen-based liquid fuel.
Aviation: This transport mode includes both domestic and international flights and their use
of aviation fuels. Domestic aviation covers flights that depart and land in the same country;
flights for military purposes are included. International aviation includes flights that land in
a country other than the departure location.
Back-up generation capacity: Households and businesses connected to a main power grid
may also have a source of back-up power generation capacity that, in the event of disruption,
can provide electricity. Back-up generators are typically fuelled with diesel or gasoline.
Capacity can be as little as a few kilowatts. Such capacity is distinct from mini-grid and offgrid systems that are not connected to a main power grid.
Battery storage: Energy storage technology that uses reversible chemical reactions to absorb
and release electricity on demand.
Biodiesel: Diesel-equivalent fuel made from the transesterification (a chemical process that
converts triglycerides in oils) of vegetable oils and animal fats.

Biomethane: Biomethane is a near-pure source of methane produced either by “upgrading”
biogas (a process that removes any carbon dioxide and other contaminants present in the
biogas) or through the gasification of solid biomass followed by methanation. It is also known
as renewable natural gas.
Buildings: The buildings sector includes energy used in residential and services buildings.
Services buildings include commercial and institutional buildings and other non-specified
buildings. Building energy use includes space heating and cooling, water heating, lighting,
appliances and cooking equipment.

emissions from fuel combustion, industrial processes or directly from the atmosphere.
Captured CO2 emissions can be stored in underground geological formations, onshore or
offshore, or used as an input or feedstock in manufacturing.
Carbon dioxide (CO2): A gas consisting of one part carbon and two parts oxygen. It is an
important greenhouse (heat-trapping) gas.
Chemical feedstock: Energy vectors used as raw materials to produce chemical products.
Examples are crude oil-based ethane or naphtha to produce ethylene in steam crackers.
Clean cooking systems: Cooking solutions that release less harmful pollutants, are more

and carbon monoxide) and then into synthetic methane.
Coal-to-liquids (CTL): Transformation of coal into liquid hydrocarbons. One route involves
coal gasification into syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), which is
processed using Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-gasoline synthesis. Another route, called
direct-coal liquefaction, involves reacting coal directly with hydrogen.
Coking coal: Type of coal that can be used for steel making (as a chemical reductant and a

produced from palm, rapeseed or soybean oil.
Critical minerals: A wide range of minerals and metals that are essential in clean energy
technologies and other modern technologies and have supply chains that are vulnerable to
disruption. Although the exact definition and criteria differ among countries, critical minerals
for clean energy technologies typically include chromium, cobalt, copper, graphite, lithium,
manganese, molybdenum, nickel, platinum group metals, zinc, rare earth elements and other
commodities, as listed in the Annex of the IEA special report on the Role of Critical Minerals
in Clean Energy Transitions available at: https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-criticalminerals-in-clean-energy-transitions.

Demand-side response (DSR): Describes actions which can influence the load profile such as
shifting the load curve in time without affecting total electricity demand, or load shedding
such as interrupting demand for a short duration or adjusting the intensity of demand for a
certain amount of time.
Direct air capture (DAC): A type of CCUS that captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere
using liquid solvents or solid sorbents. It is generally coupled with permanent storage of the
CO2 in deep geological formations or its use in the production of fuels, chemicals, building
materials or other products. When coupled with permanent geological CO2 storage, DAC is a
carbon removal technology, and it is known as direct air capture and storage (DACS).
Dispatchable generation: Refers to technologies whose power output can be readily
controlled, i.e. increased to maximum rated capacity or decreased to zero in order to match
supply with demand.
Electric arc furnace: Furnace that heats material by means of an electric arc. It is used for
scrap-based steel production but also for ferroalloys, aluminium, phosphorus or calcium
carbide.
Electric vehicles (EVs): Electric vehicles comprise of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plugin hybrid vehicles.
Electricity demand: Defined as total gross electricity generation less own use generation,
plus net trade (imports less exports), less transmission and distribution losses.
Electricity generation: Defined as the total amount of electricity generated by power only or
combined heat and power plants including generation required for own use. This is also
referred to as gross generation.
Electrolysis: Process of converting electric energy to chemical energy. Most relevant for the
energy sector is water electrolysis, which splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen
molecules. The resulting hydrogen is called electrolytic hydrogen.
End-use sectors: Include industry, transport, buildings and other, i.e., agriculture and other
non-energy use.
Energy-intensive industries: Includes production and manufacturing in the branches of iron
and steel, chemicals, non-metallic minerals (including cement), non-ferrous metals (including

the energy and industry sectors.
324

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Energy services: See useful energy.
Ethanol: Refers to bioethanol only. Ethanol is produced from fermenting any biomass high
in carbohydrates. Currently ethanol is made from starches and sugars, but secondgeneration technologies will allow it to be made from cellulose and hemicellulose, the fibrous
material that makes up the bulk of most plant matter.
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: Catalytic process to produce synthetic fuels, e.g. diesel, kerosene

Gaseous fuels: Include natural gas, biogases, synthetic methane and hydrogen.
Gases: See gaseous fuels.
Gas-to-liquids (GTL): A process that reacts methane with oxygen or steam to produce syngas
(a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The
process is similar to that used in coal-to-liquids.
Geothermal: Geothermal energy is heat from the sub-surface of the earth. Water and/or
steam carry the geothermal energy to the surface. Depending on its characteristics,
geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling purposes or be harnessed to
generate clean electricity if the temperature is adequate.
Heat (end-use): Can be obtained from the combustion of fossil or renewable fuels, direct
geothermal or solar heat systems, exothermic chemical processes and electricity (through
resistance heating or heat pumps which can extract it from ambient air and liquids). This
category refers to the wide range of end-uses, including space and water heating, and
cooking in buildings, desalination and process applications in industry. It does not include
cooling applications.
Heat (supply): Obtained from the combustion of fuels, nuclear reactors, large-scale
heat pumps, geothermal or solar resources. It may be used for heating or cooling, or
converted into mechanical energy for transport or electricity generation. Commercial heat
sold is reported under total final consumption with the fuel inputs allocated under power
generation.

tier > 1). It excludes basic improved stoves (ISO tier 0-1).
Industry: The sector includes fuel used within the manufacturing and construction industries.
Key industry branches include iron and steel, chemical and petrochemical, cement,
aluminium, and pulp and paper. Use by industries for the transformation of energy into
another form or for the production of fuels is excluded and reported separately under other
energy sector. There is an exception for fuel transformation in blast furnaces and coke ovens,
which are reported within iron and steel. Consumption of fuels for the transport of goods is
reported as part of the transport sector, while consumption by off-road vehicles is reported
under industry.
International aviation bunkers: Include the deliveries of aviation fuels to aircraft for
international aviation. Fuel used by airlines for their road vehicles are excluded. The
domestic/international split is determined on the basis of departure and landing locations
and not by the nationality of the airline. For many countries this incorrectly excludes fuels
used by domestically owned carriers for their international departures.
International marine bunkers: Include the quantities delivered to ships of all flags that are
engaged in international navigation. The international navigation may take place at sea, on
inland lakes and waterways, and in coastal waters. Consumption by ships engaged in

of port of departure and port of arrival, and not by the flag or nationality of the ship.
Consumption by fishing vessels and by military forces is excluded and instead included in the
residential, services and agriculture category.

efficiency improvements in buildings, industry and transport. Other end-use investment
includes the purchase of equipment for the direct use of renewables, electric vehicles,
electrification in buildings, industry and international marine transport, equipment for the
use of low-emissions fuels, and CCUS in industry and direct air capture. Data and projections
reflect spending over the lifetime of projects and are presented in real terms in year-2022

reported for a year reflects the amount spent in that year.
Levelised cost of electricity (LCOE): LCOE combines into a single metric all the cost elements
directly associated with a given power technology, including construction, financing, fuel,
maintenance and costs associated with a carbon price. It does not include network

Lignite: A type of coal that is used in the power sector mostly in regions near lignite mines
due to its low energy content and typically high moisture levels, which generally make longdistance transport uneconomic. Data on lignite in the World Energy Outlook include peat.
Liquid biofuels: Liquid fuels derived from biomass or waste feedstock, e.g. ethanol, biodiesel
and biojet fuels. They can be classified as conventional and advanced biofuels according to
the combination of feedstock and technologies used to produce them and their respective
maturity. Unless otherwise stated, biofuels are expressed in energy-equivalent volumes of
gasoline, diesel and kerosene.

Low-emissions hydrogen: Hydrogen that is produced from water using electricity generated
by renewables or nuclear, from fossil fuels with minimal associated methane emissions and
processed in facilities equipped to avoid CO2 emissions, e.g. via CCUS with a high capture
rate, or derived from bioenergy. In this report, total demand for low-emissions hydrogen is
larger than total final consumption of hydrogen because it additionally includes hydrogen
inputs to make low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels, biofuels production, power generation,
oil refining, and hydrogen produced and consumed onsite in industry.
Low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels: Include ammonia, methanol and other synthetic
hydrocarbons (gases and liquids) made from low-emissions hydrogen. Any carbon inputs,
e.g. from CO2, are not from fossil fuels or process emissions.
Low-emissions hydrogen-based liquid fuels: A subset of low-emissions hydrogen-based
fuels that includes only ammonia, methanol and synthetic liquid hydrocarbons, such as
synthetic kerosene.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

biofuels.
Modern renewables: Include all uses of renewable energy with the exception of the
traditional use of solid biomass.
Modern solid bioenergy: Includes all solid bioenergy products (see solid bioenergy
definition) except the traditional use of biomass. It also includes the use of solid bioenergy
in intermediate and advanced improved biomass cook stoves (ISO tier > 1), requiring fuel to
be cut in small pieces or often using processed biomass such as pellets.
Natural gas: Includes gas occurring in deposits, whether liquefied or gaseous, consisting
mainly of methane. It includes both non-associated gas originating from fields producing
hydrocarbons only in gaseous form, and associated gas produced in association with crude
oil production as well as methane recovered from coal mines (colliery gas). Natural gas
liquids, manufactured gas (produced from municipal or industrial waste, or sewage) and
quantities vented or flared are not included. Gas data in cubic metres are expressed on a
gross calorific value basis and are measured at 15 °C and at 760 mm Hg (Standard
Conditions). Gas data expressed in exajoules are on a net calorific basis. The difference
between the net and the gross calorific value is the latent heat of vaporisation of the water
vapour produced during combustion of the fuel (for gas the net calorific value is 10% lower
than the gross calorific value).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Natural gas liquids (NGLs): Liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons produced in the manufacture,
purification and stabilisation of natural gas. NGLs are portions of natural gas recovered as

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Near zero emissions material production: For steel and cement, production that achieves
the near zero GHG emissions intensity thresholds as defined in Achieving Net Zero Heavy
Industry Sectors in G7 Members (IEA, 2022). The thresholds depend on the scrap share of
metallic input for steel and the clinker-to-cement ratio for cement. For other energyintensive commodities such as aluminium, fertilisers and plastics, production that achieves
reductions in emissions intensity equivalent to the considerations for near zero emissions
steel and cement.
Near zero emissions material production capacity: Capacity that when operational will
achieve near zero emissions material production from the start.
Network gases: Include natural gas, biomethane, synthetic methane and hydrogen blended
in a gas network.

losses in converting primary energy into a form that can be used in the final consuming
sectors. It includes losses in low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels production,
bioenergy processing, gas works, petroleum refineries, coal and gas transformation and
liquefaction. It also includes energy own use in coal mines, in oil and gas extraction and in
electricity and heat production. Transfers and statistical differences are also included in this
category. Fuel transformation in blast furnaces and coke ovens are not accounted for in the
other energy sector category.

clinker.
Process heat: The use of thermal energy to produce, treat or alter manufactured goods.
Productive uses: Energy used towards an economic purpose: agriculture, industry, services
and non-energy use. Some energy demand from the transport sector, e.g. freight, could be
considered as productive, but is treated separately.

specifically the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium. REEs are key components in
some clean energy technologies, including wind turbines, electric vehicle motors and
electrolysers.
Renewables: Include bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, solar photovoltaics (PV),
concentrating solar power (CSP), wind and marine (tide and wave) energy for electricity and
heat generation.
Residential: Energy used by households including space heating and cooling, water heating,
lighting, appliances, electronic devices and cooking.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Road transport: Includes all road vehicle types (passenger cars, two/three-wheelers, light
commercial vehicles, buses and medium and heavy freight trucks).
Self-sufficiency: Corresponds to indigenous production divided by total primary energy
demand.
330

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

Services: A component of the buildings sector. It represents energy used in commercial
facilities, e.g. offices, shops, hotels, restaurants, and in institutional buildings, e.g. schools,
hospitals, public offices. Energy use in services includes space heating and cooling, water
heating, lighting, appliances, cooking and desalination.
Shale gas: Natural gas contained within a commonly occurring rock classified as shale. Shale
formations are characterised by low permeability, with more limited ability of gas to flow
through the rock than is the case within a conventional reservoir. Shale gas is generally
produced using hydraulic fracturing.
Shipping/navigation: This transport mode includes both domestic and international
navigation and their use of marine fuels. Domestic navigation covers the transport of goods
or people on inland waterways and for national sea voyages (starts and ends in the same
country without any intermediate foreign port). International navigation includes quantities
of fuels delivered to merchant ships (including passenger ships) of any nationality for
consumption during international voyages transporting goods or passengers.
Single-use plastics (or disposable plastics): Plastic items used only one time before disposal.
Solar: Includes both solar photovoltaics and concentrating solar power.
Solar home systems (SHS): Small-scale photovoltaic and battery stand-alone systems, i.e.
with capacity higher than 10 watt peak (Wp) supplying electricity for single households or
small businesses. They are most often used off-grid, but also where grid supply is not reliable.
Access to electricity in the IEA definition considers solar home systems from 25 Wp in rural
areas and 50 Wp in urban areas. It excludes smaller solar lighting systems, e.g. solar lanterns
of less than 11 Wp.
Solar photovoltaics (PV): Electricity produced from solar photovoltaic cells including utilityscale and small-scale installations.
Solid bioenergy: Includes charcoal, fuelwood, dung, agricultural residues, wood waste and
other solid biogenic wastes.
Solid fuels: Include coal, modern solid bioenergy, traditional use of biomass and industrial
and municipal wastes.
Stand-alone systems: Small-scale autonomous electricity supply for households or small
businesses. They are generally used off-grid, but also where grid supply is not reliable. Standalone systems include solar home systems, small wind or hydro generators, diesel or gasoline
generators. The difference compared with mini-grids is in scale and that stand-alone systems
do not have a distribution network serving multiple costumers.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Steam coal: A type of coal that is mainly used for heat production or steam-raising in power
plants and, to a lesser extent, in industry. Typically, steam coal is not of sufficient quality for
steel making. Coal of this quality is also commonly known as thermal coal.
Synthetic methane: Methane from sources other than natural gas, including coal-to-gas and
low-emissions synthetic methane.
Annex C | Definitions

331

C

Synthetic oil: Synthetic oil produced through Fischer-Tropsch conversion or methanol
synthesis. It includes oil products from CTL and GTL, and non-ammonia low-emissions liquid
hydrogen-based fuels.
Tight oil: Oil produced from shale or other very low permeability formations, generally using
hydraulic fracturing. This is also sometimes referred to as light tight oil. Tight oil includes tight
crude oil and condensate production except for the United States, which includes tight crude
oil only (US tight condensate volumes are included in natural gas liquids).
Total energy supply (TES): Represents domestic demand only and is broken down into
electricity and heat generation, other energy sector and total final consumption.
Total final consumption (TFC): Is the sum of consumption by the various end-use sectors.
TFC is broken down into energy demand in the following sectors: industry (including
manufacturing, mining, chemicals production, blast furnaces and coke ovens); transport;
buildings (including residential and services); and other (including agriculture and other nonenergy use). It excludes international marine and aviation bunkers, except at world level
where it is included in the transport sector.
Total final energy consumption (TFEC): Is a variable defined primarily for tracking progress
towards target 7.2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). It
incorporates total final consumption by end-use sectors, but excludes non-energy use. It
excludes international marine and aviation bunkers, except at world level. Typically this is
used in the context of calculating the renewable energy share in total final energy
consumption (indicator SDG 7.2.1), where TFEC is the denominator.
Traditional use of biomass: Refers to the use of solid biomass with basic technologies, such
as a three-stone fire or basic improved cook stoves (ISO tier 0-1), often with no or poorly
operating chimneys. Forms of biomass used include wood, wood waste, charcoal agricultural
residues and other bio-sourced fuels such as animal dung.
Transport: Fuels and electricity used in the transport of goods or people within the national
territory irrespective of the economic sector within which the activity occurs. This includes:
fuel and electricity delivered to vehicles using public roads or for use in rail vehicles; fuel
delivered to vessels for domestic navigation; fuel delivered to aircraft for domestic aviation;
and energy consumed in the delivery of fuels through pipelines. Fuel delivered to
international marine and aviation bunkers is presented only at the world level and is
excluded from the transport sector at a domestic level.
Trucks: Includes all size categories of commercial vehicles: light trucks (gross vehicle weight
< 3.5 tonnes); medium freight trucks (gross vehicle weight 3.5-15 tonnes); and heavy freight
trucks (gross vehicle weight > 15 tonnes).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Unabated fossil fuel use: Consumption of fossil fuels in facilities without CCUS.
Useful energy: Refers to the energy that is available to end-users to satisfy their needs. This
is also referred to as energy services demand. As result of transformation losses at the point
of use, the amount of useful energy is lower than the corresponding final energy demand for
332

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2023

most technologies. Equipment using electricity often has higher conversion efficiency than
equipment using other fuels, meaning that for a unit of energy consumed, electricity can
provide more energy services.
Value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE): Incorporates information on both
costs and the value provided to the system. Based on the LCOE, estimates of energy, capacity
and flexibility value are incorporated to provide a more complete metric of competitiveness
for power generation technologies.
Variable renewable energy (VRE): Refers to technologies whose maximum output at any
time depends on the availability of fluctuating renewable energy resources. VRE includes a
broad array of technologies such as wind power, solar PV, run-of-river hydro, concentrating
solar power (where no thermal storage is included) and marine (tidal and wave).
Zero carbon-ready buildings: A zero carbon-ready building is highly energy efficient and
either uses renewable energy directly or an energy supply that can be fully decarbonised,
such as electricity or district heat.
Zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs): Vehicles that are capable of operating without tailpipe CO2
emissions (battery electric and fuel cell vehicles).

Annex E
Inputs to the Global Energy and Climate Model
General note
This annex includes references of databases and publications used to provide input data to
the IEA Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model. The IEA’s own databases of energy and
economic statistics provide much of the data used in the GEC Model. These include IEA
statistics on energy supply, transformation, demand at detailed levels, carbon dioxide
emissions from fuel combustion and energy efficiency indicators that form the bedrock of
the World Energy Outlook modelling and analyses.
Supplemental data from a wide range of external sources are also used to complement IEA
data and provide additional detail. This list of databases and publications is comprehensive,
but not exhaustive.

World Energy Outlook 2023
The World Energy Outlook 2023 provides in-depth analysis and
strategic insights into every aspect of the global energy system.
Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions and fragile energy
