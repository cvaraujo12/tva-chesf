Foreword
The world is facing perilous times. Escalating conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s
continued war in Ukraine have global attention sharply focused on some of the world’s most
important energy-producing regions. While some of the acute impacts of the global energy
crisis have receded, geopolitical uncertainty is exposing the underlying fragilities of the global
energy system, regardless of technology or geography. Energy infrastructure is also facing
increasing risks from extreme weather events that are becoming an all too common aspect
of life for people around the world.
Too often, the worst impacts of these crises are reserved for the poorest in societies,
especially in emerging and developing economies. Today, the greatest energy injustice is the
hundreds of millions of people, mostly in Africa, who still lack access to basic energy services
such as electricity or safe stoves for cooking.
With all these issues front of mind, energy security is again a major theme of this year’s World
Energy Outlook (WEO). In our fast-changing world, the concept of energy security goes well
beyond safeguarding against traditional risks to oil and natural gas supplies, as important as
that remains for the global economy. It also means ensuring access to affordable energy
supplies; anticipating emerging risks in the electricity sector; shoring up supply chains for
clean energy technologies and the critical minerals required to make them; and tackling the
rising threats that extreme weather events pose to energy systems.
All these areas are key priorities for the IEA’s day-to-day work. To advance the global
discussion on these issues, the IEA is convening a major International Summit on the Future
of Energy Security in the second quarter of 2025, hosted in London by the UK Government,
to build a common understanding of the importance of energy security and what it takes to
truly deliver it in the context of clean energy transitions.
The analysis in this year’s Outlook reinforces my long-held conviction that energy security
and climate action go hand-in-hand: the world does not need to choose between ensuring
reliable energy supplies and addressing the climate crisis. This is because deploying costcompetitive clean energy technologies represents a lasting solution not only for bringing
down emissions, but also for reducing reliance on fuels that have been prone to volatility and
disruption.

The latest Outlook also confirms that the contours of a new, more electrified energy system
are becoming increasingly evident, with major implications on how we meet rising demand
for energy services. Clean electricity is the future, and one of the striking findings of this
Outlook is how fast demand for electricity is set to rise, with the equivalent of the electricity
use of the world’s ten largest cities being added to global demand each year.
This WEO highlights, once again, the choices that can move the energy system in a safer and
more sustainable direction. I urge decision makers around the world to use this analysis to
understand how the energy landscape is changing, and how to accelerate this clean energy
transformation in ways that benefit people’s lives and future prosperity.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Executive Summary
Geopolitical tensions and fragmentation are major risks for energy security
and for coordinated action on reducing emissions
Escalating conflict in the Middle East and Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine underscore the
continued energy security risks that the world faces. Some of the immediate effects of the
global energy crisis had started to recede in 2023, but the risk of further disruptions is now
very high. The experience of the last few years shows how quickly dependencies can turn
into vulnerabilities; a lesson that applies also to clean energy supply chains that have high
levels of market concentration. Markets for traditional fuels and for clean technologies are
becoming more fragmented: since 2020, almost 200 trade measures affecting clean energy
technologies – most of them restrictive – have been introduced around the world, compared
with 40 in the preceding five-year period.
Fragility in today’s energy markets is a reminder of the abiding importance of energy
security – the foundational and central mission of the International Energy Agency (IEA) –
and the ways that more efficient, cleaner energy systems can reduce energy security risks.
The increasingly visible impacts of climate change, the momentum behind clean energy
transitions, and the characteristics of clean energy technologies are all changing what it
means to have secure energy systems. A comprehensive approach to energy security
therefore needs to extend beyond traditional fuels to cover the secure transformation of the
electricity sector and the resilience of clean energy supply chains. Energy security and climate
action are inextricably linked: extreme weather events, intensified by decades of high
emissions, are already posing profound energy security risks.
Clean energy transitions have accelerated sharply in recent years, shaped by government
policies and industrial strategies, but there is more near-term uncertainty than usual over
how these policies and strategies will evolve. Countries representing half of global energy
demand are holding elections in 2024, and energy and climate issues have been prominent
themes for voters that have been buffeted by high fuel and electricity prices, and by floods
and heatwaves. Yet energy policies and climate targets, influential though they are, are not
the only forces behind the continued rise of clean energy. There are strong cost drivers, as
well as intense competition for leadership in clean energy sectors that are major sources of
innovation, economic growth and employment. More than ever, the energy outlook is
complex, multifaceted and defies a single view on how the future might unfold.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Robust, independent analysis and data-driven insights are vital to navigate
today’s energy uncertainties
Reflecting today’s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are complemented by sensitivity
cases for renewables, electric mobility, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and how heatwaves,
efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) might affect electricity demand.
The scenarios and sensitivity cases illustrate different pathways that the energy sector could
follow, the levers that decision-makers can use to reach them, and their implications for
energy markets, security and emissions, and for people’s lives and livelihoods. The Stated
Policies Scenario (STEPS) provides a sense of the energy sector’s direction of travel today,
based on the latest market data, technology costs and in-depth analysis of the prevailing
Executive Summary

15

policy settings in countries around the world. The STEPS also provides the backdrop for the
upside and downside sensitivity cases. The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) examines
what would happen if all national energy and climate targets made by governments,
including net zero goals, are met in full and on time. The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)
Scenario maps out an increasingly narrow path to reach net zero emissions by mid-century
in a way that limits global warming to 1.5 °C.

Geopolitical risks abound but underlying market balances are easing, setting
the stage for intense competition between different fuels and technologies
The next phase in the journey to a safer and more sustainable energy system is set to take
place in a new energy market context, marked by continued geopolitical hazards but also
by relatively abundant supply of multiple fuels and technologies. Our detailed analysis of
market balances and supply chains brings an overhang of oil and LNG supply into view during
the second half of the 2020s, alongside a large surfeit of manufacturing capacity for some
key clean energy technologies, notably for solar PV and batteries. These provide something
of a buffer against further market disruptions, but also imply downward pressure on prices
and a period of increased competition among suppliers. The rapid rise in clean energy
deployment in recent years came during a period of price volatility for fossil fuels. Clean
technology costs are coming down, but maintaining and accelerating momentum behind
their deployment in a lower fuel-price world is a different proposition. How consumer
choices and government policies play out will have huge consequences for the future of the
energy sector, and for tackling climate change.

How fast will clean energy transitions unfold?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Clean energy is entering the energy system at an unprecedented rate, including more than
560 gigawatts (GW) of new renewables capacity added in 2023, but deployment is far from
uniform across technologies and countries. Investment flows to clean energy projects are
approaching USD 2 trillion each year, almost double the combined amount spent on new oil,
gas and coal supply – and costs for most clean technologies are resuming a downward trend
after rising in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. This helps renewable power
generation capacity rise from 4 250 GW today to nearly 10 000 GW in 2030 in the STEPS,
short of the tripling target set at COP28 but more than enough, in aggregate, to cover the
growth in global electricity demand, and to push coal-fired generation into decline. Together
with nuclear power, which is the subject of renewed interest in many countries, lowemissions sources are set to generate more than half of the world’s electricity before 2030.
China stands out: it accounted for 60% of the new renewable capacity added worldwide in
2023 – and China’s solar PV generation alone is on course to exceed, by the early 2030s,
the total electricity demand of the United States today. There are open questions, in China
and elsewhere, about how quickly and efficiently new renewable capacity can be integrated
into power systems, and whether grid expansions and permitting times keep pace. Policy
uncertainty and a high cost of capital are holding back clean energy projects in many
developing economies. Recent clean energy trends in advanced economies present a mixed
picture, with accelerations in some areas accompanied by slowdowns in others, including a

large fall in heat pump sales in Europe in the first half of 2024. Progress on the other headline
commitments from COP28 is lagging: the goal of doubling the global rate of energy efficiency
improvements could provide larger emissions reductions by 2030 than anything else, but
looks far out of reach under today’s policy settings. Tried and tested policies and technologies
are likewise available to deliver a major reduction in methane emissions from fossil fuel
operations, but abatement efforts have been patchy and uneven.

Clean energy momentum remains strong enough to bring a peak in demand
for each of the fossil fuels by 2030
Demand for energy services is rising rapidly, led by emerging and developing economies,
but the continued progress of transitions means that, by the end of the decade, the global
economy can continue to grow without using additional amounts of oil, natural gas or coal.
This has not been the case in recent years: despite record clean energy deployment, twothirds of the increase in global energy demand in 2023 was met by fossil fuels, pushing
energy-related CO2 emissions to another record high. In the STEPS, the largest sources of
rising demand for energy are, in descending order, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and
Africa. But growth in clean energy and structural changes in the global economy, particularly
in China, are starting to temper overall energy demand growth, not least because a more
electrified, renewables-rich system is inherently more efficient than one dominated by fossil
fuel combustion (in which a lot of the energy generated is lost as waste heat). Outcomes in
individual years can vary in practice depending on broader economic or weather conditions,
or in hydropower output, but the direction of travel under today’s policy settings is clear.
Continued growth in global energy demand post-2030 can be met solely with clean energy.

The world has the need and the capacity to go much faster

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Ample clean energy manufacturing capacity creates scope for faster transitions that move
towards alignment with national and global net zero goals, but this means addressing
imbalances in today’s investment flows and clean energy supply chains. Over the past five
years, annual solar capacity additions quadrupled to 425 GW, but annual manufacturing
capacity is set for a sixfold increase to more than 1 100 GW, a level that – if deployed in full
– would be very close to the amounts needed in the NZE Scenario. There is a similar story of
plentiful manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries. Bringing these technologies at
scale to developing economies would be transformative for the global outlook, helping rising
demand to be met in a sustainable way and allowing global emissions not only to peak in the
coming years, as they do in the STEPS, but also to enter a meaningful decline, which they do
not do in the STEPS. This requires concerted efforts to facilitate investment in developing
economies by addressing risks that push up the cost of capital. Periods of ample supply make
life difficult for new entrants, but improving the resilience and diversity of the supply chains
for clean energy technologies and for critical minerals remains an essential task. For the
moment, these supply chains are heavily concentrated in China.

Demand for electricity is taking off, but how high will it go?
The contours of a new, more electrified energy system are coming into focus as global
electricity demand soars. Electricity use has grown at twice the pace of overall energy
Executive Summary

demand over the last decade, with two-thirds of the global increase in electricity demand
over the last ten years coming from China. Electricity demand growth is set to accelerate
further in the years ahead, adding the equivalent of Japanese demand to global electricity
use each year in the STEPS, and rising even more quickly in scenarios that meet national and
global net zero goals. The projections for global electricity demand in STEPS are 6%, or
2 200 terawatt-hours (TWh), higher in 2035 than in last year’s Outlook, driven by light
industrial consumption, electric mobility, cooling, and data centres and AI.
Rising data centre electricity use, linked in part to growing use of AI, is already having some
strong local impacts, but the potential implications of AI for energy are broader and include
improved systems coordination in the power sector and shorter innovation cycles. There
are more than 11 000 data centres registered worldwide and they are often spatially
concentrated, so local effects on electricity markets can be substantial. However, at a global
level, data centres account for a relatively small share of overall electricity demand growth
to 2030. More frequent and intense heatwaves than we assume in the STEPS, or higher
performance standards applied to new appliances – notably air conditioners – both produce
significantly greater variations in projected electricity demand than an upside case for data
centres. The combination of rising incomes and increasing global temperatures generate
more than 1 200 TWh of extra global demand for cooling by 2035 in the STEPS, an amount
greater than the entire Middle East’s electricity use today.

The rise of electric mobility, led by China, is wrong-footing oil producers
The slowdown in oil demand growth in the STEPS puts major resource owners in a bind as
they face a significant overhang of supply. China has been the engine of oil market growth
in recent decades, but that engine is now switching over to electricity: the country’s oil use
for road transport is projected to decline in the STEPS, although offset by a large increase in
oil use as a petrochemical feedstock. India becomes the main source of oil demand growth,
adding almost 2 million barrels per day (mb/d) to 2035. Cost-competitive EVs – many of them
from Chinese manufacturers – are making inroads in a range of markets, although there is
uncertainty over how fast their share will grow. EVs currently have a share of around 20% in
new car sales worldwide, and this rises towards 50% by 2030 in the STEPS (a level already
being achieved in China this year), by which time EVs displace around 6 mb/d of oil demand.
If the market share of electric cars were to rise more slowly, remaining below 40% by the
end of the decade, this would add 1.2 mb/d to projected oil demand in 2030, but there would
still be a visible flattening in the global trajectory. Additional near-term oil supply is coming
mainly from the Americas – the United States, Brazil, Guyana and Canada – and this is putting
pressure on the market management strategies of the OPEC+ grouping. The STEPS sees
prices around USD 75-80 per barrel, but this implies further production restraint and an
increase in spare capacity, which is already at record levels of around 6 mb/d.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Who will ride the wave of new LNG?
An increase of nearly 50% in global LNG export capacity is on the horizon, led by the United
States and Qatar, but the prices that many suppliers need to recover their investments may
not entice developing economies to switch to natural gas at scale: something has to give.
18

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Around 270 billion cubic metres (bcm) of annualised new LNG capacity has been approved
and, if delivered according to announced schedules, is set to enter into operation over the
period to 2030, a huge addition to global supply. In the STEPS, LNG demand grows by more
than 2.5% per year to 2035, an upward revision from last year’s outlook and faster than the
rise in overall gas demand. Europe and China have the import infrastructure to absorb
significantly more gas, but their scope to clear the market is constrained by their investments
in clean energy. Gas-importing emerging and developing economies would generally need
prices at around USD 3-5/MBtu to make gas attractive as a large-scale alternative to
renewables and coal, but delivered costs for most new export projects need to average
around USD 8/MBtu to cover their investments and operation. If gas markets are to absorb
all the prospective new LNG supply and to continue to grow past 2030, this would require
some combination of even lower clearing prices, higher electricity demand and slower
energy transitions – with less wind and solar, lower rates of building efficiency
improvements, and fewer heat pumps – than projected in the STEPS. However, any
acceleration of global energy transitions towards the outcomes projected in the APS or NZE
Scenario, or a wild card for supply like a large new Russia-China gas supply deal (which we
do not include in the STEPS), would exacerbate the LNG glut.

Lower fuel prices ease concerns about affordability and industrial
competitiveness in fuel-importing economies
The new market context may provide some breathing space for fuel-importing countries
and regions – such as Europe, and South and Southeast Asia – that have been hit hard by
higher prices for fossil fuels and electricity in recent years. Consumers around the world
spent nearly USD 10 trillion on energy in 2022 during the global energy crisis, around half of
which ended up as record revenues for oil and gas producers. An easing of price levels
promises some welcome relief, particularly in fuel-importing countries. Lower natural gas
prices should lift some of Europe’s gloom about its industrial competitiveness, although
Europe still faces a sizeable structural energy price disadvantage compared with the United
States and China. The breathing space from fuel price pressures can provide policymakers
with room to focus on stepping up investment in renewables, grids, storage and efficiency;
facilitating the removal of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies; and allowing developing economies
to regain the momentum that was lost in recent years behind the provision of access to
electricity and clean cooking fuels. However, cheaper natural gas can also slow structural
changes by diminishing the economic case for consumers to switch to cleaner technologies,
and by making it more difficult to close the cost gap with alternatives like biomethane and
low-emissions hydrogen.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

A sustainable energy system needs to be people-centred and resilient
A new energy system needs to be built to last: this means prioritising security, resilience
and flexibility, and ensuring that the benefits of the new energy economy are shared. The
STEPS does not see traditional energy security concerns diminishing, particularly for
importers in Asia that face a long-term rise in their dependence on oil and gas imports to
nearly 90% for oil and around 60% for gas by 2050. At the same time, faster clean energy
transitions put the spotlight on electricity security, as growing electricity demand and more
Executive Summary

variable generation increase the operational need for flexibility in power systems, both for
short-term and seasonal needs. This also requires a rebalancing of power sector investment
towards grids and battery storage, as proposed by the IEA in advance of the COP29 1 climate
conference in Baku, Azerbaijan. At the moment, for every dollar spent on renewable power,
60 cents are spent on grids and storage. By the 2040s, this reaches parity in all scenarios.
Many power systems are vulnerable to an increase in extreme weather events and
cyberattacks, putting a premium on adequate investments in resilience and digital security.
Dividing lines are emerging on energy and climate, which can only be bridged if there is
more help provided to poorer countries, communities and households to manage the
upfront costs of change, including much greater international support. High financing costs
and project risks are limiting the spread of cost-competitive clean energy technologies to
where they are needed most, especially in developing economies where they can deliver the
biggest returns for sustainable development and affordability. Lack of access to modern
energy is the most fundamental inequity in today’s energy system, with 750 million people
– predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa – remaining without access to electricity and more
than 2 billion without clean cooking fuels. The outlook for access projects is improving thanks
to cheaper technologies, new policies, the growing availability of digital payment options and
pay-as-you-go business models, but more is needed, including a stronger focus on
electrifying productive uses, which can improve project bankability. The climate finance
discussions at COP29 and at the G20 will be a barometer of the prospects for scaling up clean
energy investment in developing economies, which will also require strengthened national
policy visions, policies and institutions, and a willingness to engage with the private sector.

Choices and consequences

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Despite gathering momentum behind transitions, the world is still a long way from a
trajectory aligned with its climate goals. Decisions by governments, investors and
consumers too often entrench the flaws in today’s energy system, rather than pushing it
towards a cleaner and safer path. There are some positive developments in the STEPS, but
today’s policy settings still put the world on course for a rise of 2.4 °C in global average
temperatures by 2100, entailing ever more severe risks from a changing climate. Our
scenario analysis highlights the prospect of buyers and consumers having the edge in energy
markets for a time, with suppliers competing for their attention as they make fuel and
technology choices that have widely different implications for the energy sector and for its
emissions. All parties need to recognise that locking in fossil fuel use has consequences.
There may be downward pressure on fuel prices for a while, but energy history tells us that
one day the cycle will be reversed, and prices will rise. And the costs of climate inaction,
meanwhile, grow higher by the day as emissions accumulate in the atmosphere and extreme
weather imposes its own unpredictable price. By contrast, clean technologies that are
increasingly cost-effective today are set to remain so, with greatly reduced exposure to the
vagaries of commodity markets and lasting benefits for people and planet.

Chapter 1
Overview and key findings
Where do we go from here?
S U M M A R Y
• There are three overarching and inter-related themes for this year’s Outlook. The first
is energy security, corresponding to the longstanding core of the IEA’s mandate as
well as the imperatives of the present given escalating risks in the Middle East. The
second relates to the prospects for clean energy transitions, which have accelerated
rapidly in recent years, but which need to move much faster to meet climate goals. A
third theme is uncertainty, an ever-present factor in any forward-looking analysis but
particularly visible this year: our Outlook includes several sensitivity cases on key
factors affecting oil, gas and electricity demand in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS).

• The potential for near-term disruption to oil and gas supply is high due to conflict in
the Middle East. Around 20% of today’s global oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG)
supplies flow through the Strait of Hormuz, a maritime chokepoint in the region.
However, while geopolitical risks remain elevated, an easing in underlying market
balances and prices is on the horizon as slowing oil demand growth in the STEPS sees
spare crude oil production capacity rise to 8 million barrels per day by 2030. A wave
of new LNG projects is set to add almost 50% to available export capacity by 2030.

• In all our scenarios, growth in global energy demand slows thanks to efficiency gains,
electrification and a rapid buildout of renewables. In the STEPS by 2030, nearly every
other car sold in the world is electric, although delays in the roll-out of charging
infrastructure or in policy implementation could lead to slower growth.

• Clean energy meets virtually all growth in energy demand in aggregate in the STEPS
between 2023 and 2035, leading to an overall peak in demand for all three fossil fuels
before 2030, although trends vary widely across countries at different stages of
economic and energy development.

• Electricity demand grows much faster than overall energy demand, thanks to existing
uses, notably cooling, and new ones such as electric mobility and data centres.
Renewables lead the expansion in electricity generation, with sufficient speed to meet
in aggregate all the increases in demand. There is scope to go even faster: today’s
solar manufacturing capacity hovers around 1 100 GW per year, potentially allowing
for deployment almost three-times higher than in 2023.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• The share of clean energy investment in emerging market and developing economies
outside of China remains stuck at 15% of the total, even though these economies
account for two-thirds of the global population and one-third of global GDP. A range
of new business models and a policy push in some countries ensure that an additional
550 million people gain access to clean cooking and nearly 200 million to electricity in
the STEPS between 2023 and 2030. This still falls well short of universal access goals.

Introduction
After a period of extreme turbulence caused first by the Covid-19 pandemic and then the
global energy crisis that was intensified by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian
Federation (herein after Russia) in 2022, this edition of the World Energy Outlook again
unfolds against a backdrop of acute geopolitical tensions. Russia’s war in Ukraine continues
alongside the clear risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East. The range of possible
outcomes and the risk of near-term oil price rises is large. As ever, energy security is a major
theme of this year’s analysis.
A second theme for this Outlook is the momentum behind clean energy transitions amid
rising evidence of the risks to the global climate posed by emissions. Structural changes in
energy production and consumption have gained speed over recent years, especially in
advanced economies and the People’s Republic of China (herein after China), raising hopes
that the world can soon put global energy-related emissions into decline and accelerate the
journey towards a net zero emissions system. We examine the state-of-play in detail, the
implications for fossil fuels, and what it would take to align the trajectory with national and
global energy and climate goals.
A third theme is uncertainty. Voters in countries accounting for half of global energy demand
went to the polls in 2024 in national or regional elections, with energy and climate issues
prominent in many campaigns. The speed at which clean technologies make their way into
the market is likewise subject to uncertainty, as is the frequency and intensity of extreme
weather events. This edition of the Outlook therefore includes a number of sensitivity cases,
against the backdrop of the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), alongside the scenario
modelling of trajectories that meet national and global net zero emissions targets.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

After a brief overview of the main scenario results, the bulk of this chapter explores these
themes through a series of questions, covering the following issues:


Against a backdrop of heightened international tensions, what do today’s fractured
geopolitics mean for the future of energy?



What do market data and our projections tell us about the prospects for electric
mobility: are electric vehicle sales hitting speed limits?



Electricity demand growth is accelerating, but which factors – including data centres and
artificial intelligence – will determine how fast it grows?



Given the rise in electricity demand, can clean power generation expand fast enough to
bring down emissions in the power sector?



There is a wave of new liquefied natural gas coming to market: where will it go and what
will be the implications for gas demand and prices?



With hundreds of millions of people remaining without access to electricity and clean
cooking fuels, what will it take to achieve access goals by 2030?



How to correct the large imbalance and scale up clean energy investment in emerging
market and developing economies?

Scenario overview

1.1.1

Energy demand

The last decade has seen the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix gradually come
down from 82% in 2013 to 80% in 2023. Demand for energy has increased by 15% over this
period and 40% of this growth has been met by clean energy, i.e. renewables in the power
and end-use sectors, nuclear, and low-emissions fuels, including carbon capture, utilisation
and storage (CCUS).
In advanced economies, overall energy demand declined on average by 0.5% per year over
the past decade. Oil demand peaked in this grouping in 2005, coal has been in structural
decline since 2008 while natural gas, in aggregate, has ceased to grow. Nuclear has fallen
around one-half percentage point per year, while renewables have increased by 3% per year
since 2013.
In emerging market and developing economies – a grouping that includes almost 85% of the
world’s population – energy demand increased at around 2.6% per year over the last decade.
The underlying drivers are a rise in the population of more than 720 million people, a 50%
rise in the size of the economy and a 40% increase in industrial output. Floorspace in buildings
has increased by 40 000 square kilometres, enough to cover the entirety of the Netherlands.
With this rapid rate of development, clean energy has to work harder to displace oil, gas and
coal in emerging market and developing economies than in advanced economies.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), clean energy deployment accelerates as the pace of
overall energy demand growth slows, leading to a peak in all three fossil fuels before 2030
(Figure 1.1). Increasing reductions in coal demand means it is overtaken by natural gas in the
global energy mix by 2030. Clean energy grows more than total energy demand between
2023 and 2035. Led by surging solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power, clean energy
becomes the largest source of energy in the mid-2030s.
Although the STEPS sees a threefold increase in renewables that brings fossil fuel use down
from 80% of total energy demand in 2023 to 58% in 2050, this falls far short of the step
change that occurs in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and the Net Zero Emissions by
2050 (NZE) Scenario, especially the latter. In both these scenarios, renewables begin to
rapidly eat into the fossil fuel market share. By 2035, clean energy meets 40% of global
energy demand in the APS, and this rises to nearly three-quarters by 2050. In the
NZE Scenario, clean energy meets 90% of global energy demand in 2050. Around one-third
of the remaining fossil fuel demand in the NZE Scenario is fully abated, around half is used
as a feedstock or in other non-energy use, and the remainder is offset by direct air capture,
negative emissions from bioenergy or other forms of carbon removal.

1.1.2

Total final consumption

The energy intensity of the global economy has been falling due to technological progress,
efficiency improvements and changes in the structure of the global economy (Figure 1.2).
Growth in renewables and increasing electrification of end-uses both play an important part
to increase the efficiency of energy systems.

Historically, the expansion of gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been faster than the
rate of energy demand growth, reflecting improvements in the energy intensity of GDP.
These improvements in energy intensity continue and even accelerate in our scenarios:
global GDP continues to expand, but it takes steadily less energy to fuel this growth (Box 1.1).
Electric technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles deliver energy services more
efficiently than those reliant on the direct combustion of fossil fuels, and efficiency gains and
electrification also arrest further growth in per capita energy consumption in emerging
market and developing economies, despite higher levels of ownership of vehicles and
appliances such as air conditioners.
Box 1.1 ⊳

What factors explain slowing growth in global energy demand?

Over the past decade, global energy demand increased at an annual average rate of 1.4%.
In the STEPS, this slows to around 0.5% per year on average between 2023 and 2035,
three-times slower than in the past. This is not a result of slower economic growth: global
GDP growth is expected to average 3% annually between 2023-2035, similar to the
previous decade. Underlying energy services demand, such as for lighting, cooling and
mobility, is projected to continue to rise at least as fast as in the past, even though there
is a distinct slowdown in global population growth: between 2023 and 2035, annual
population growth is around 85% of the average level seen between 2013 and 2023.
The slowdown in global energy demand in our scenarios is driven by a combination of
three main factors.
The first factor is improvements in the technical efficiency of energy use, via more
efficient processes or equipment. These kinds of improvements and technological
innovations are a longstanding feature of the global energy system and are heavily
influenced by policies that incentivise efficiency gains, like minimum energy performance
standards or other forms of regulation. There is an uptick in the projected pace of
technical efficiency improvements in our scenarios, but this is much more visible in the
APS and in the NZE Scenario than in the STEPS.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The second explanatory factor relates to changes in the structure of the global economy
towards the provision of services, which require less energy, and away from energyintensive sectors. Here we see an evolution in future trends compared with the past, as
growth rates for energy-intensive materials such as steel and aluminium are projected to
moderate compared with the rates seen in the last decade. This is due in part to structural
changes in China’s economy.
The third factor, which is increasingly influential in our scenarios, relates to the effect on
energy demand of introducing more renewables and more electrified end-uses into the
energy system, as these are inherently more efficient than processes based on fossil fuel
combustion (which generates a lot of waste heat, also known as conversion losses).
Unlike fossil fuels, most renewables are considered 100% efficient, i.e. conversion losses
are not measured because the resources are directly harnessed from naturally occurring
26

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

sources of energy, such as sunlight, wind and water, without the need for extraction or
combustion processes. As renewables take a larger share of electricity generation, the
total amount of primary energy inputs required to meet electricity demand from
households, businesses and public services decreases. The rising share of electricity in
total final consumption also has a dampening effect on energy demand growth because
it displaces the direct use of gas, coal and oil, all of which typically involve energy
conversion losses.
Global final energy consumption currently stands at 445 exajoules (EJ). In the STEPS, this rises
steadily to over 530 EJ by 2050. In the APS and NZE Scenario, total final consumption starts
to fall back (Figure 1.3). It is 3% lower than current levels of demand by 2035 in the APS, and
15% lower in the NZE Scenario. In the APS, energy efficiency gains limit growth in
consumption even as living standards continue to rise, thanks to additional retrofit targets,
broader electrification, more stringent fuel economy standards in transport, and more rapid
efficiency gains in industry. In the NZE Scenario, year-on-year energy intensity improvements
more than double by 2035: this reflects both faster electrification and a more rapid phase
out of traditional use of biomass, which is largely replaced by more efficient sources such as
electricity and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Behavioural changes also play a role.

Electrification accelerates across all scenarios and in all sectors, providing heating, cooling
and mobility, powering motors and appliances, and producing onsite electrolytic hydrogen
for heavy industry. By 2050, the share of electricity in total final consumption increases by
half in the STEPS, doubles in the APS and nearly triples in the NZE Scenario, where unabated
fossil fuels are swiftly replaced by electricity generated by clean sources. Along with the
direct use of renewables, including modern bioenergy, solar thermal and geothermal, and
low-emissions hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels, the share of unabated fossil fuels by
2050 declines from today’s level by 30% in the STEPS, over 65% in the APS and 95% in the
NZE Scenario. In hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping, biofuels and lowemissions fuels displace around 50 EJ of fossil fuels by 2050 in the NZE Scenario.

1.1.3

CO2 emissions

CO2 emissions peak in all scenarios before 2030, but the subsequent rate of decline varies
considerably. In the STEPS, emissions fall 1% per year between 2030 and 2050, led by a 3%
annual decline in emissions in China, where they end up at half of the current level by 2050
(Figure 1.4). In the APS, global emissions fall by 4% per year, and in the NZE Scenario they fall
by 15% per year, three-times faster than the drop recorded in 2020 after the onset of the
Covid-19 pandemic. The STEPS trajectory implies an average temperature increase of
2.4 degrees Celsius (°C) by 2100. In the APS, the increase is 1.7 °C, while this World Energy
Outlook-2024 (WEO-2024) updated NZE Scenario shows an increasingly narrow but still
achievable pathway to limiting the temperature rise to below 1.5 °C.

An increasing number of emerging market and developing countries have announced targets
or goals to achieve net zero CO2 or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. They include eight-outof-ten Southeast Asian countries, plus India, which is targeting net zero emissions by 2070.
These targets are achieved in full in the APS, driving innovation and providing incentives for
consumers and private sector actors to reduce emissions. As a result, CO2 emissions from
India and Southeast Asia fall by half in the APS, dropping below 2010 levels by 2050.

1.2

What do fractured geopolitics mean for the future of
energy?

1.2.1

Fossil fuels

The global energy crisis triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted the
vulnerability of the current energy system to geopolitical events and underlined how much
of an impact energy price rises can have on consumers. The immediate price shocks from the
energy crisis have abated, but escalating hostilities in the Middle East and attacks on shipping
in the Red Sea serve as reminders of the potential for wider world events to cause shocks to
energy markets.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure expansions set to come online over the next
ten years should provide some buffer against potential outages, and imply downward
pressure on prices (Box 1.2). Global spare crude oil production capacity, excluding Iran and
Russia, which averaged less than 3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2019, stands today at
around 6 mb/d. If announced capacity additions by members of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) proceed, the level of demand growth in the STEPS
would mean spare capacity rising to 8 mb/d to 2030. For natural gas, a large new wave of
LNG liquefaction projects is set to come online that is set to produce a surplus of LNG supply
over demand until 2040 (section 1.6).
Ample spare crude oil capacity and new LNG supplies provide buffers against the risk of sharp
price shocks, but the security of fuel supplies is far from guaranteed, not least because the
effectiveness of this capacity to address any shortfalls that may arise hinges on the ability of
alternative sources of supply to reach an affected country or region quickly. Moreover, a
general trend of increased supply concentration and rising import dependence means supply
shocks – if they occur – have the potential to be more disruptive. Asia has become the focal
point for global oil and gas trade: it now imports more than twice as much oil as Europe, the
next-largest importing region, and it eclipsed Europe as the largest market for imported
natural gas in 2022 (Figure 1.5). In the STEPS, these trends continue. China – the world’s
largest importer – sees its dependence on oil imports rise from around 75% today to more
than 80% by 2050. Similar trends are projected for India, where natural gas dependence rises
from 50% today to nearly 75%. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia, which is currently a net exporter
of natural gas, becomes a net importer before 2030.

Asia.

Key maritime trade routes remain vital to the well-being of global oil and gas markets. This
includes the safe passage of ships through passages such as the Strait of Malacca and Strait
of Hormuz. The Strait of Malacca is particularly important to oil and gas trade, and is set to
become even more so in the future, with oil volumes increasing from 24 mb/d today (55% of
global oil trade) to 28 mb/d in the STEPS, and LNG flows increasing from 70 billion cubic
metres (bcm) in 2023 (12% of global LNG trade) to 140 bcm in 2050. Around 20% of global
oil and LNG supplies also flow through the Strait of Hormuz today, a share that remains
broadly constant in the STEPS. Any disruption in either of these straits could lead to supply
shortages and price volatility. A complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz, while unlikely,
would be particularly damaging because there are limited alternative routes to market and
because it would block off the vast majority of OPEC spare capacity.

Are oil and natural gas prices set to fall and what would this mean
for producers?

Oil and natural gas prices act as intermediaries between supply and demand in our
scenarios to ensure that sources of supply meet changes in demand and hold the system
in equilibrium. This balancing act means that prices in our scenarios follow a relatively
smooth trajectory; we do not attempt to anticipate the fluctuations or price cycles that
30

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

characterise commodity markets. Oil prices are contingent on continued efforts by major
oil producers to manage oil markets; there is no analogous arrangement for natural gas,
but the increasing importance of global LNG trade means benchmark prices in different
regional markets become increasingly interdependent. In practice, the potential for oil
and gas price volatility is ever present, especially given the profound changes that are
needed in today’s energy system to meet the world’s climate goals.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The oil price in the STEPS remains broadly similar over the projection period to what it
was in 2023 (Figure 1.6), with technological improvements, continued efforts by the oil
and gas industry to keep a lid on costs and downward pressure from a slight decline in
demand more or less offset by the need to tap into more remote and difficult-to-access
resources. This trajectory rests on the assumption that market management efforts by
major producers are pursued and are effective in putting a floor under prices; this cannot
be taken for granted. In the APS, lower demand levels mean that prices fall to much lower
levels then they are at today. In the NZE Scenario, the oil price drops to the operating
costs of the marginal project required to meet falling demand. In both of these scenarios,
policies need to be designed to ensure that lower prices do not result in a rebound in oil
demand which would undercut overall emissions reduction efforts.
For natural gas, the overhang in LNG capacity looks set to create a very competitive
market at least until this is worked off, with prices in key importing regions averaging
USD 6.5-8 million British thermal units (MBtu) to 2035. The lowest cost existing LNG

projects – those that have paid off their initial invested capital and/or that benefit from
low cost feedgas and low operating costs – can make a profit at prices of USD 3-5/MBtu,
but many under construction projects have break even costs above USD 8/MBtu. This
poses major risks for the sponsors of these LNG projects or the offtakers, as some of the
value of their assets might end up having to be written off. In the STEPS, the LNG
overhang is worked off in the 2030s and prices paid by importers then rise. In the APS
and NZE Scenario, demand for LNG remains well below the supply that is available and
so prices around the world are much lower. Lower prices could stimulate additional
demand for natural gas and LNG (a prospect further explored in Chapter 4); however,
policy settings favouring renewables and energy efficiency may constrain a robust
demand response.
In the STEPS, net income to oil and gas producers remains largely flat at around
USD 2 400 billion to 2035. It falls to USD 1 750 billion in the APS by 2035, or 30% less than
the average levels over the past five years, and to USD 680 billion in the NZE Scenario by
2035, 70% lower than recent levels. Many oil and gas producers would struggle to
withstand the strains on their fiscal balances from lower income in this scenario.

1.2.2

Clean energy supply chains and critical minerals

New energy security hazards are emerging as the world moves towards a more electrified
and renewables-rich energy system, highlighting the need for policy makers to continually
adjust and assess their approach to energy security. One issue of particular concern for many
policy makers today is the concentration in a small number of countries of clean energy
supply chains for manufacturing capacity and critical mineral mining and processing. China
has a very large proportion of existing manufacturing capacity for key clean energy
technologies. This includes 85-95% of global manufacturing capacity for battery cathode and
anode materials, more than 80% of global solar PV manufacturing capacity, and more than
75-90% of the global processing capacity for cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

A wide range of countries are looking to bolster domestic clean energy manufacturing. Both
the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net Zero Industry Act include major incentives for
domestic manufacturing, and around 10% of the USD 2 trillion clean energy investment
earmarked by governments around the world since 2020 comes with conditions that require
local content. Some countries are also taking steps in their trade policies to address concerns
about aspects of current trade in clean energy manufacturing through tariff adjustments,
antidumping duties and countervailing measures.
There are some signs of success in efforts to diversify supply chains. In battery cell
manufacturing, for example, announced capacity additions in Europe and the United States
should be sufficient to meet the 2030 domestic deployment needs associated with their
climate goals, provided that all planned projects come online as scheduled. In many other
clean energy supply chains, however, a large portion of planned projects are being developed
32

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

in precisely the regions where most capacity is already located (Figure 1.7). For example,
some 50-95% of supply growth between 2023 and 2035 for refined copper, lithium, nickel
and cobalt is projected to take place in today’s largest producer, such as China or Indonesia.

Announced projects indicate that the geographic concentration of critical minerals
and clean energy technology manufacturing is set to remain high through to 2030
Note: Critical minerals data are refined material production.

Another concern is the level of critical mineral supplies that are available. For a number of
critical minerals, supply growth from the pipeline of confirmed and announced projects is set
to be slower than expected growth in demand. The situation is most pressing for copper and
lithium, highlighting some new risks to supply security and clean energy transitions. Market
signals should lead to the development of new projects, although new mining projects tend
to have very long lead times. On the demand side, changes in battery chemistries or
enhanced efforts for recycling may succeed in reducing demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Policy makers need to be alert to the new energy security risks that are emerging in clean
energy and look for ways to mitigate them. However, there are some important differences
between the risks for consumers associated with clean energy and those that arise from
traditional fuels. With traditional fuels, a shortage in supply means that consumers
immediately face higher prices to continue operating existing equipment such as cars and
boilers. With clean energy, a shortage in supplies would tend to increase the cost of new
equipment but would have little immediate effect on the cost of using existing equipment.

Are EV sales hitting speed limits?

Electric vehicles provide the main mechanism to decarbonise the road transport sector. Their
prospects in recent years have been bolstered by ambitious plans from governments and the
EV and battery industries (Table 1.1). However, the transition to mass market adoption is
unlikely to be linear, and additional efforts are required to achieve the right balance of
incentives for broader consumer uptake, to ensure that adequate charging infrastructure is
in place and to reinforce electricity grids.
Over 7 million electric cars were sold in the first-half of 2024, which represents an increase
of close to 25% compared to the same period a year ago. The share of EVs in the total global
car fleet is likely to approach around 5% by the end of 2024. China accounts for nearly 80%
of the increase, with sales rising from more than 3 million in the first-half of 2023 to over
4 million in the first-half of 2024. Even if China is set to one side, however, the overall
percentage rise in sales elsewhere in the global market is over 10%. While sales in the
European Union remained flat, with a decline in Germany offsetting a rise elsewhere of
around 3% on average, the United Kingdom saw a 15% rise, and the United States recorded
an increase of nearly 10%. Large jumps in year-on-year sales also occurred in nascent EV
markets such as Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, the Caspian region and the Middle East.
One important trend is the rising share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales, which
accounted for over 35% of total EV sales in the first-half of 2024. In China, the PHEV sales
increase was largely driven by range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) which have longer
driving ranges due to larger batteries. This provides an average electric range of around
130 kilometres (km), compared with 80 km for a standard PHEV (BNEF, 2024a). Sales of
PHEVs, including REEVs, surged by 70% in China, while sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs)
rose by only 15%. Similarly, in the United States PHEV sales increased by 25%, compared to
just 5% for BEVs. This highlights the need for an expansion of recharging infrastructure to
ease range anxiety.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

EV sales are anticipated to be robust over the rest of 2024, with around 17 million electric
cars being sold over the course of the year. China is expected to continue dominating global
growth, with electric car sales topping over 10 million during 2024. It is worth noting in this
context that the EV market in China has maintained strong momentum through August, with
monthly sales exceeding 1 million units (EV Volumes, 2024). The continuing rise in EV sales
is well above what was predicted by some analysts in 2022 when battery costs increased by
7%. In fact, this increase prompted the battery industry to adopt different chemistries that
require less cobalt and nickel, and this – together with further developments in battery
technology – has led battery cell prices to drop below USD 80 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) during
the first nine months of 2024.

Future landscape for electric vehicles

Around 30 countries have set zero emissions vehicle goals or timelines to phase out
internal combustion engine vehicles. In the STEPS, electric car sales reach more than
40 million globally by 2030, which means that nearly one-in-two cars sold that year will
be either a battery electric or a plug-in hybrid vehicle.
The number of electric car sales in the STEPS is aligned with the plans of the automotive
industry. Although some automakers have recently scaled back short-term EV production
plans, their longer-term EV plans still point to the production of well over 40 million
electric cars per year by 2030. The projections in the STEPS are also in line with those of
other outlooks (Figure 1.8).

As there are inevitably uncertainties surrounding the future level of EV sales, we explore
a range of potential shifts in EV trends. In our sensitivity analysis, the share of electric
cars in new registrations ranges from less than 40% to 50% by 2030, with key
differentiators being the scale of consumer adoption, the level of government support
for EVs and the rate of expansion of charging infrastructure. Depending on the pace of
EV uptake and the utilisation of the electric mode of PHEVs, global oil demand could vary
from 101 mb/d to 103 mb/d by 2030. Similarly, global electricity demand could differ
between the high and low case by around 350 terawatt-hours (TWh), highlighting the farreaching changes that EVs could bring across the whole energy sector (See Chapter 4).
36

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

1.3.1

Trends in the EV market

Challenges and uncertainties are inevitable, but there are strong underlying reasons why EV
sales are likely to continue to expand rapidly. One of the most important is that battery prices
are continuing to fall, prompting automakers to reduce EV sticker prices. Key automakers in
the United States have reduced the price of their main models by more than USD 10 000, for
example (IEA, 2024a). Chinese automakers have also made price reductions of around
USD 1 600 compared to 2022 (BNEF, 2024b). European automakers are meanwhile planning
to launch seven new models in 2025 priced at under USD 28 000 (T&E, 2024). While some
automakers have adjusted their short-term targets and made slight changes to their longer
term 2030 projections, their commitment to EVs remains robust across the board. The same
is true for the battery industry globally, which is currently experiencing consolidation rather
than a reduction in plans.
Although some incentive schemes have been revised, governments remain active in
supporting EV uptake in a variety of ways (Table 1.1). China recently launched a new tradein policy to encourage drivers to scrap less efficient vehicles and replace them with either
electric or more efficient ones, and is looking at ways to speed development of charging
infrastructure. In the European Union, stringent CO2 standards are prompting automakers to
expand EV production. The United States aims to increase EV uptake by providing subsidies
under the Inflation Reduction Act and to support the development of charging infrastructure
under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
But there is much still to do, and delays in the roll-out of charging infrastructure or in policy
implementation could lead to the market share of electric cars in 2030 being about ten
percentage points lower than projected in the STEPS, though this would still mean a big
increase in EV shares from current levels (see Chapter 4).

1.3.2

Implications of the transition to EVs for the energy sector

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In energy terms, the adoption of EVs means a shift from a fossil fuel-based mobility system
to one that relies much more on critical minerals, and a linking of the transport and power
sectors. There are clear synergies between manufacturing batteries for EVs and for energy
storage, and processes from one industry can benefit the other. For example, EV batteries
could be repurposed for storage applications. They could also support grid flexibility through
smart charging, helping to optimise grid load, and through bi-directional charging, supplying
power to buildings or the grid (IEA, 2024b).
In the STEPS, electricity demand from EVs rises from 115 TWh today to around 1 000 TWh by
2030 – an amount equivalent to today’s electricity demand in Japan. This increase accounts
for around 15% of total global electricity demand growth. Significant as this is, the impact of
EVs on the oil market is even more significant (Figure 1.9). Over the past decade, road
transport has increased oil demand by 4.2 mb/d, accounting for more than 45% of global oil
demand growth. However, oil demand for passenger cars declines by 1 mb/d from today’s
levels by 2030, and this is largely responsible for global oil demand reaching a peak by the
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

end of this decade in the STEPS. With renewables providing an ever-increasing share of
power generation, electro-mobility helps to drive the world towards its climate
commitments, and EVs displace nearly 10 billion barrels of oil from 2020 to 2030, avoiding a
total of over 4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) emissions in the process.

Key enablers to achieve net zero emissions milestones for EVs

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, nearly one-in-two cars sold are electric by 2030. In the NZE Scenario, electric
cars account for over two-thirds of sales by 2030. Achieving this level requires further
movement in a number of areas. One of the most pressing is cost differentials. Despite recent
price reductions, on average an electric car is USD 10 000-15 000 more expensive than a
comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, though this is much less of an
issue in China, where over 60% of electric cars are priced below their conventional
counterparts (IEA, 2024a). Another critical issue is the need for extensive charging
infrastructure. To achieve a two-thirds market share of electric cars, investment of nearly
USD 1000 billion will be required from now until 2030, which represents a 45% increase over
levels in the STEPS. A third issue is meeting the demand for batteries. Annual EV battery
demand reaches around 5.5 TWh by 2030 in the NZE Scenario, up from 0.8 TWh in 2023.
However, the battery industry seems well-positioned to meet this escalating demand, with
recent announcements and developments indicating a robust capacity to scale up production
and develop technology.

How fast might demand for electricity increase?

The global energy economy is increasingly electrifying. Since 2010, electricity demand has
increased on average by 2.7% per year, while overall energy demand has risen by 1.4% per
year. Electricity is increasingly being used in place of fossil fuels to provide heat, mobility and
industrial energy demand. Innovations such as smart grids and advances in the efficiency of
electric motors and appliances have also boosted the appeal of electricity.
The share of electricity in total final consumption rises more rapidly than in the past in all
three scenarios and across nearly all regions. This trend is a consequence of increased
electrification in households and commercial buildings as well as in transport and industry.
Most of this demand growth is from emerging market and developing economies. China
dominates, but other countries make a significant contribution, especially after 2030.
However, the pace of demand growth – and the uncertainties surrounding it – also pose
challenges for ensuring a secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply.

Emerging market and developing economies lead demand growth in
the STEPS

In the STEPS, global electricity demand nearly doubles by 2050, rising to 50 000 TWh from
26 000 TWh in 2023. From 2023 to 2035 alone, growth averages nearly 1 000 TWh per year,
equivalent to adding another Japan to global electricity consumption each year.
Trends vary by sector. The transport sector has the lowest current rate of electrification in
final consumption, but it also sees the fastest rate of projected demand growth as EVs
account for a rising share of vehicle sales (section 1.3). Increased space cooling and appliance
ownership drive electricity demand growth in the buildings sector, underpinned by economic
expansion. Electrification in industry is also a significant factor.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Emerging market and developing economies are projected to contribute nearly 80% of
growth in electricity demand to 2030 in the STEPS, with China alone making up over 45% of
the global growth total (Figure 1.10). China’s energy sector has electrified particularly fast,
with electricity rising from 11% of final consumption in 2000 to 26% in 2023: a major cause
was surging electricity use in the buildings sector, with growing incomes leading to rapid
increases in appliances and demand for space cooling, while space heating has also
increasingly been electrified. China’s demand rises further in the coming decades, with the
rapid uptake of EVs being a key driver. The story in India is similar, though starting from a
lower base: the share of electricity in final consumption rose in India from 11% in 2000 to
18% in 2023, and half of the electricity demand growth to 2050 is projected in the STEPS to
come in the buildings sector.
After a period of slower growth, trends in advanced economies are changing. In the United
States, the share of electricity in final consumption was static from 2010 to 2023 at under
22%, but it rises to nearly 40% by 2050 in the STEPS, with an expanding EV fleet accounting
for 65% of overall demand growth. After falling in recent years, electricity demand in the

European Union is also shifting back to growth, and the share of electricity in final
consumption today more than doubles to 45% in 2050 in the STEPS. Rising demand from EVs
is again one of the main causes, along with more electrification of space heating in the
buildings sector.

1.4.2

Exploring uncertainties in the STEPS

Electricity demand is subject to major uncertainties, and could be higher or lower than
projected. One key uncertainty revolves around possible variations in the outlook for the
building sector, which in the STEPS is set to deliver nearly 45% of electricity demand growth
in final consumption by 2035, mostly from increased cooling and appliance use.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Demand for space cooling in buildings rises at an average annual rate of 3.7% to 2035 in the
STEPS. Over 90% of this growth takes place in emerging market and developing economies,
where economic growth and rising incomes drive air conditioner ownership, while a warming
global climate boosts demand and leads to air conditioners having to work harder to provide
cooling (see Chapter 3, section 3.3.2). As well as raising overall demand, cooling is projected
to lead to higher peaks in demand, putting additional strain on power grids.

40

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Demand growth from cooling could be even stronger than projected in the STEPS. Heat
waves trigger increased demand for air conditioning, as seen in the prolonged recent heat
wave in India, which reportedly doubled sales of cooling units (BBC, 2024). A sensitivity
analysis exploring the impact of more frequent, intense and lengthy heat waves on air
conditioner ownership and usage finds that they could increase electricity demand for
cooling in 2035 by as much as 700 TWh (20%) more than projected in the STEPS (see
section 4.6.2). About 80% of this additional increase occurs in emerging market and
developing economies, mostly in developing Asia (Figure 1.11).

Note: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

Energy efficiency improvements, supported by strong policy measures, are key to
moderating the fast growth projected in appliance ownership, floorspace and overall living
standards. But current trends indicate limited progress on efficiency in key markets, and
highlight the risk that weak, disparate efficiency standards could lock in additional demand
in fast-growing regions. A sensitivity analysis indicates that lower efficiencies could cause
electricity demand for appliances and cooling in emerging market and developing economies
to be around 340 TWh (5%) higher than in the STEPS by 2035. By contrast, faster adoption of
effective efficiency standards could result in electricity demand being almost 900 TWh lower
in 2035 in these end-uses than in the STEPS, highlighting the value of action in these areas to
temper future demand growth (see Chapter 4, section 4.6.3).

Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

Box 1.4 ⊳

Data centre and artificial intelligence energy demand
is set to expand

Nascent sectors or trends add to uncertainties in projections. One example is data
centres: not a new source of electricity demand, but now in a new phase of growth arising
from both the increasing digitalisation of the economy and advances in technology,
including artificial intelligence (AI).
With established technology companies and AI start-ups making major investments, a
sharp rise in electricity consumption by data centres looks inevitable, but the relatively
early stage of this new phase of growth and sparse data availability mean that any
projections are bound to be tentative. Among other things, the pace of growth may be
restricted by supply chain bottlenecks, particularly for the chips that handle AI and other
compute-intensive workloads. Challenges in building local grids and generation capacity
may also constrain growth.
Our assessment of uncertainties indicates that demand growth to 2030 could vary from
the STEPS by as much as 170 TWh. It also suggests that, while data centre electricity
demand will grow, it is likely to account for a relatively small share of total global
electricity demand growth to 2030, although the sector will be more significant at the
national or regional level in major data centre markets (see Chapter 4, section 4.6.1).

1.4.3

Clean energy transitions are driving rapid electricity demand growth

Clean energy transitions are a primary cause of fast-rising global electricity demand
(Figure 1.12). Faster electrification of end-uses and the decarbonisation of power grids
together play a vital role to improve efficiency and reduce emissions, as reflected in the APS
and NZE Scenario. In 2050, total electricity demand reaches 60 000 TWh in the APS and
66 000 TWh in the NZE Scenario – as much as a third higher than the 50 000 TWh projected
in the STEPS.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The pace and scale of the electrification of transport is a key differentiator of electricity
demand across the three World Energy Outlook (WEO) scenarios. The projected share of EV
sales in total road vehicle sales reaches 70% in 2035 in the APS, compared with 55% in the
STEPS, and this translates into a 465 TWh increase in electricity demand from road transport
in the APS compared to the STEPS. In the NZE Scenario, near universal adoption of EVs by
2035 means a 1 500 TWh increase compared to the STEPS.
Faster uptake of heat pumps is central to efforts to boost energy efficiency and cut fossil fuel
use in buildings. Although sales of heat pumps slowed in 2023 in some regions, and saw a
major slowdown in Europe in the first half of 2024, their market share in space heating is still
set to almost double by 2035 in the STEPS, and to reach approximately 30% in the APS and
40% in the NZE Scenario. Their high efficiency means the additional electricity demand from
heat pumps is modest, adding only around 325 TWh by 2035 in the STEPS, 445 TWh in the
APS and 425 TWh in the NZE Scenario.

Electrification of road transport and electrolytic hydrogen production to tackle emissions in
hard-to-abate sectors significantly boosts electricity demand in transition scenarios
Notes: AE = advanced economies; Other EMDE= emerging market and developing economies other than China
and India. Electricity demand for heat pumps represents space heating in buildings. Electricity demand for
hydrogen production includes onsite production for industry and refineries.

The use of electricity to produce hydrogen, including onsite production for the steel,
ammonia and refining industries, has the potential to increase demand for electricity very
significantly. But the scale and timing are highly uncertain because they are contingent on
how quickly different hydrogen production pathways and use develop. Electricity demand
for hydrogen production increases from less than 5 TWh today to 9 000 TWh in the APS in
2050. In the NZE Scenario, electricity demand for hydrogen production reaches nearly
15 000 TWh in 2050, equivalent to over 55% of global electricity demand today.
As societies come to depend ever more on electricity, especially in rapid energy transitions,
reliable supply becomes paramount (Box 1.5).
Box 1.5 ⊳

Electricity is at the heart of energy security

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Many of the new energy security challenges in a decarbonising world arise in the power
sector as societies come to depend more on electricity for their energy needs. There are
two core elements of electricity security: the ability to ensure sufficient capacity to meet
peak demand (adequacy), and the ability to manage fluctuations in both demand and
renewable energy supply (flexibility).
Peak demand is projected to rise faster than overall electricity demand in all scenarios,
and up to 80% faster in emerging market and developing economies by 2035 in the STEPS
(Figure 1.13). Efficiency measures like improved insulation and more efficient appliances

Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

help avoid a bigger rise, along with measures that enable demand-side flexibility such as
smart meters and dynamic tariffs. Batteries become essential for dispatchable capacity,
and over 1 700 gigawatts (GW) of battery capacity are added in the STEPS by 2035.
Natural gas and coal plants continue to play a role to provide dispatchable capacity in
emerging market and developing economies, but the larger share of short-term flexibility
is projected to be met by batteries and demand response, with seasonal needs met
largely by hydropower and thermal plants.

Higher activity and end-use electrification are key drivers of peak demand growth, but
efficiency gains and nascent demand-side flexibility mitigate some of the increase
Notes: Other EMDE = emerging market and developing economies other than China. Peak demand is the
average level of demand for the 100 hours of the year with the highest demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

A larger share of variable renewables raises the potential for imbalances between
available supply and demand. A good deal of seasonal energy demand is also transferred
onto the power system through the increasing use of electric heating and cooling
equipment. Electricity storage, stronger grids, demand-side response and dispatchable
low-emissions sources of power are essential to meet flexibility requirements in clean
energy transitions, and the STEPS sees investment in grids increase by nearly 70% to 2030
to modernise and extend them, and investment in battery storage nearly triples.
Load patterns may also change as more end-uses become electric. This presents both a
challenge and an opportunity. While the APS sees short-term flexibility requirements in
2050 increase up to seven times in some regions, it also sees half of those requirements
met by maximising the scope for demand response, for example by shifting peak load to
reflect when owners charge EVs or operate heat pumps. Measures of this kind would also
help to keep household electricity bills down.

Is clean power generation growing fast enough?

Rapidly scaling up low-emissions sources of electricity is a central part of any clean energy
transition. While the electricity sector is the largest emitting energy sector today, a lot of
action is in hand to reduce those emissions, driven by national and international
commitments. For renewables, ambitious collective goals were set at COP28, including to
triple global installed capacity of renewable energy by 2030, while over 150 countries have
policies to expand the use of renewables in the power sector. For nuclear power, an initiative
was established in December 2023 that targets a tripling of global nuclear capacity by 2050,
and more than 30 countries have plans to expand their use of nuclear energy. There are
additional initiatives to accelerate less mature technologies including carbon capture and
low-emissions hydrogen. All the actions taking place are vital to efforts to decarbonise
electricity and achieve the COP28 goal of transitioning away from fossil fuels in line with net
zero emissions by 2050.
Many clean energy technologies are already mature. Solar PV and wind are now the cheapest
electricity sources in most markets, and hydropower and bioenergy are well-established
contributors. A new generation of large-scale nuclear reactors is being built in several
countries with enhanced features, and small modular reactors are under development. In
addition, the importance of a systems approach – including the need to expand and
modernise electricity grids and accelerate the uptake of energy storage and demand
response – is increasingly recognised as essential to deliver the most affordable and secure
transitions (IEA, 2024c).

1.5.1

Clean power is not yet outrunning global electricity demand growth

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

One of the biggest success stories in clean energy transitions to date has been the rapid rise
of solar PV and wind power. Between 2010 and 2023, global solar PV capacity increased
40-times and wind power six-times, with growth concentrated in China, European Union,
United States and Japan. At the same time, more mature renewable energy technologies
have also expanded, with bioenergy capacity increasing 2.5-times and hydropower
1.4-times. Nuclear power capacity has been broadly stable over the period.
Despite these gains, growth in clean power generation has not kept pace with global
electricity demand. Global output from low-emissions sources of electricity, including all
renewable energy technologies, nuclear, fossil fuels with carbon capture, hydrogen and
ammonia, increased by 4 800 TWh from 2010 to 2023, but global electricity generation
increased by nearly 8 400 TWh (Figure 1.14). Wind and solar PV together accounted for
three-quarters of clean power growth over the period, and hydro, bioenergy, geothermal
and nuclear power (in that order) accounted for the final quarter. To fill the gap, global coalfired generation increased by almost 2 000 TWh (+23%) from 2010 to 2023 and gas-fired
output increased by over 1 700 TWh (+36%). As a result, electricity sector CO2 emissions
increased by 20% over the period, rising from 11.4 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2010 to 13.7 Gt in 2023.

Since 2010, installed capacity of solar PV expanded 40-fold, wind 6-fold, bioenergy 2.5-fold
and hydro 1.4-fold, but electricity demand increased faster than clean power generation
Note: Other low-emissions includes geothermal, concentrated solar power, marine, fossil fuels with carbon
capture and low-emissions hydrogen and ammonia.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In some regions, clean power has increased faster than electricity demand and reduced the
need for unabated fossil fuels. Low-emissions sources of electricity grew by over 20%
between 2018 and 2023 in countries including Australia, Korea, Japan, Argentina, South
Africa, Brazil and Mexico: in all these countries, they outstripped any electricity demand
growth, leading to reductions in the use of unabated fossil fuels (Figure 1.15). Low-emissions
sources increased by around 10% or less in the European Union, United Kingdom and United
States, but this was enough to outpace any demand growth and reduce the use of unabated
fossil fuels in each case.
In several emerging market and developing economies, low-emissions sources were not able
to keep pace with overall electricity demand growth between 2018 and 2023, leading to
increased use of coal and natural gas to generate power. China is the global market leader in
the deployment of clean power technologies, including solar PV, wind, hydro and nuclear
power, but it has also seen coal-fired power increase by over 20% and natural gas by 40%
over the last five years. Since its electricity demand is far larger than that of any other
country, the speed at which China transitions to clean energy is of huge significance, and it
will be a landmark day when clean power growth in China outstrips overall electricity
demand. India and Indonesia have increased clean power by 40% and 50% respectively over
the past five years, but from a low starting point, and the use of unabated fossil fuels in the
power sector has also increased significantly. Given the high level of dependence on coal in
both countries, their near-term plans for clean energy transitions and long-term
commitments to reach net zero emissions are crucially important.

1.5.2

Clean power gets up to speed in most markets by 2030

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

From 2023 to 2030, growth of clean power sources outpaces electricity demand growth
globally by 20% under current policy settings and market conditions. Renewables account
for the vast majority of clean power growth to 2030, and renewables investment steps up
from around USD 680 billion in 2023 to USD 850 billion in 2030, delivering annual average
capacity additions of more than 600 GW of solar PV, about 160 GW of wind, around 30 GW
of hydropower and 12 GW of other renewables. In total, renewables capacity worldwide
increases 2.3-fold to 2030 in the STEPS. Nuclear power contributes to the growth of clean
power sources reflecting efforts to maintain the existing fleet of nuclear reactors and
construction of new reactors in around 30 countries. As a result, electricity generation from
unabated fossil fuels declines to 2030, with falls of more than 10% in coal-fired power and
50% in oil-fired power more than offsetting about a 5% rise for natural gas. However,
transitions away from fossil fuels must move faster to fulfil announced pledges, including the
pledges to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 and to pursue net zero emissions by
2050.
In advanced economies, clean power increases twice as much as electricity demand to 2030,
and both wind and solar PV individually nearly keep pace with electricity demand growth
(Figure 1.16). Nuclear power increases due to a mix of lifetime extensions, new construction,
return to operation of existing reactors in France and a progressive re-start of existing
reactors in Japan. Electricity generation from fossil fuels declines by 30% to 2030: coal-fired
power reduces by 50% and gas-fired power by 15%.

Low-emissions sources outpace electricity demand growth in advanced economies to

Note: EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

In emerging market and developing economies, clean power growth starts to match strong
electricity demand growth in the STEPS. Clean power expands by 5 800 TWh from 2023 to
2030, and electricity sector CO2 emissions in emerging market and developing economies
collectively peak in the mid-2020s. Solar PV dominates, providing over half of the increase in
clean power between now and 2030 in the STEPS, with wind making the second-largest
contribution and hydropower, other renewables and nuclear each also delivering a share of
the increase. China alone accounts for almost 70% of emerging market and developing
economies clean power growth, rising fast enough to keep pace with rising demand for
electricity in China. Despite this progress in emerging market and developing economies,
unabated fossil fuel use in 2030 remains nearly at current levels. Coal-fired power sees a
slight decline over the years to 2030, while gas-fired generation rises.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

1.5.3

Clean power needs to scale up faster to get on track
for net zero emissions

While clean power is gaining momentum, today’s policy settings and market conditions do
not deliver fast enough growth to move onto a pathway to net zero emissions. In the
NZE Scenario, which does move countries collectively onto such a pathway, global clean
power generation increases twice as fast to 2035 as in the STEPS. To close the gap between
the STEPS and the NZE Scenario through to 2035, clean power needs to expand 1.5-times
faster in China, 1.9-times faster in advanced economies, and three-times faster in the other
48

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

emerging market and developing economies. The faster uptake of clean power in the
NZE Scenario leads to an 85% reduction in unabated coal-fired power and a 55% reduction
in unabated gas-fired power by 2035, compared with a 35% reduction for coal-fired power
and virtually no change for natural gas in the STEPS. To create the widest path possible to
net zero emissions, all clean power technologies make a bigger contribution to reducing
emissions than they do in the STEPS, though these contributions are differentiated by how
mature and accessible the technologies are, by their respective costs, and by technology
preferences in various economies, which are often expressed through differences in national
policies.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage.

Despite their growth in the STEPS, solar PV and wind need to expand more than any other
clean energy technologies to close the gap between the STEPS and the NZE Scenario, with
the latter calling for an additional 7 000 TWh of solar PV and 5 000 TWh of wind by 2035
(Figure 1.17). The additional growth required in the NZE Scenario reflects the widespread
availability of solar PV and wind, the strong policy support they enjoy in most countries and
their cost advantages, since they are now the cheapest new sources of electricity in most
markets. In the case of solar PV, it also reflects the excess manufacturing capacity that
already exists, and which is anticipated to augment in the coming years (IEA, 2024d). A
number of actions need to be taken to deliver the additional solar PV and wind called for in
the NZE Scenario: these will vary from country to country but are likely in many cases to
include taking immediate steps to address permitting and licensing issues, resolve grid

connection delays and accelerate deployment of batteries and other energy storage
technologies. Special efforts are needed to scale up financing for clean power in emerging
market and developing economies outside China (section 1.8).
Vital as solar PV and wind are, the deployment of a wide set of dispatchable low-emissions
sources, including hydropower, bioenergy and nuclear power, is essential for affordable and
secure clean energy transitions. The NZE Scenario calls for about 1 000 TWh more hydro by
2035 than the STEPS does, and for about 650 TWh more bioenergy. While they are both
mature technologies, their potential for growth is more limited than that of solar and wind,
not least because of the limits on resource availability. There is also a gap of about 1 400 TWh
between the NZE Scenario and the STEPS on nuclear power. This is significant, but much
smaller than those for solar PV and wind: not all countries choose to use nuclear technology,
and it involves relatively high initial costs and long construction times.
If the power sector is to lead the way to net zero emissions, new low-emissions options need
to be brought to market by 2035. Small modular reactors are one of these technologies, and
their development helps to accelerate the contribution of nuclear in the NZE Scenario. The
deployment of carbon capture technologies and the use of low-emissions hydrogen and
ammonia are also important, since they can be used to reduce emissions from existing coalfired power plants which between them would use the entire remaining carbon budget to
1.5 °C if operated as they are today (IEA, 2022). By 2035, fossil fuels with CCUS and lowemissions hydrogen and ammonia start to make an impact in the NZE Scenario: together they
deliver an additional 1 100 TWh over what is in the STEPS, setting them up to play an
important part in decarbonising energy beyond 2035.

1.6

There is a wave of new LNG coming: where will it go?

There has been a major reorientation in natural gas trade routes since the cut in Russian
pipeline exports to Europe. A large new wave of LNG export capacity is also set to come on
line: if all projects that are under construction are completed on time, available liquefaction
capacity is expected to rise globally from 580 bcm per year today to 850 bcm per year in 2030
(Figure 1.18). 1 This increase in export capacity is larger than projected LNG demand growth
in all three scenarios; the result is an overhang of capacity which is set to depress
international gas prices and set the stage for fierce competition between suppliers.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

On average, the delivered cost of LNG is around USD 4.50/MBtu, but costs vary widely. The
most cost-competitive sources of LNG are projects that have paid off their initial invested
capital and that benefit from low cost feedgas and low operating costs, such as the Qatari
LNG trains that started in the early 2000s. Around 40% of existing projects have yet to recover
1 Available liquefaction capacity differs from nameplate capacity and is calculated as the capacity available
taking into account maintenance, downtime and upstream supply availability at existing plants, as well as
projects under construction that are currently labelled as shelved, suspended or under force majeure.
Globally, it is around 90% of nameplate capacity.

fully their invested capital, having been online for less than the typical ten-year period over
which debt is recovered in project finance for large-scale LNG terminals. For projects under
construction, average delivered costs are estimated to be around USD 8/MBtu, but there is
a risk that this may increase due to mounting cost inflation amid a queue of projects. Indeed,
delays or significant budget overruns have already affected around 20% of the projects that
have made a final investment decision since 2019.

An unprecedented volume of LNG is due to come online in the second-half of the 2020s,
led by a near-doubling of export capacity in the United States and Qatar

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, existing LNG export capacity and new capacity under construction are together
sufficient to meet projected demand to 2040 (Figure 1.19). The utilisation rates of LNG plants
average around 75% of nameplate capacity between 2025 and 2035 in the STEPS, which
reflects very loose market conditions. After 2040, additional capacity is required as LNG
demand continues to increase, and by 2050 the amount of additional capacity needed rises
to around 180 bcm, most of which comes from the Middle East and North America.
Ample LNG supply in the second-half of the 2020s raises the question of whether demand
might rise higher than projected in the STEPS. There is around 1 500 bcm of LNG import
capacity around the world, and an additional 160 bcm is under construction. This suggests
that there is sufficient infrastructure in place to handle additional LNG cargoes in most
importing countries. As of mid-2024, around one-third of export capacity under construction
is as yet uncontracted, meaning these additional volumes will be made available on the spot
market to buyers, who are likely to be interested if prices look competitive against incumbent
fuels or technologies. There are many price-sensitive markets in Asia, such as those for
fertiliser in India or power generation in Pakistan, which in theory could ramp up LNG imports
in response to lower prices.

LNG supply capacity outpaces demand in each scenario to 2030;
only in the STEPS is there a need for new capacity beyond 2040

The problem for LNG suppliers is that, once all the costs of liquefaction, shipping and
regasification are taken into account, it becomes a relatively expensive fuel, and a supplier
could struggle to compete in emerging and developing markets while providing sufficient
returns. For example, in countries such as India, imported gas prices would need to be
around USD 3-5/MBtu to compete with coal, and prices in that range are likely to be below
the delivered cost of LNG for many export projects around the world.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, the degree of demand response to the LNG surplus is constrained by the
projected scale of renewables deployment, a gradual reduction in the potential for increased
coal-to-gas switching as coal plants retire, and faster efficiency gains and electrification rates
than in the past. Moreover, the markets with ample infrastructure in place to receive
additional LNG, notably Europe and China, are also those that are making the most rapid
progress with energy transitions, reducing the likelihood that they will absorb major
additional volumes of LNG.
China in particular poses a conundrum: at around 8% in 2023, natural gas still accounts for a
relatively small share of the overall energy mix, suggesting scope for expansion. But slowing
economic growth sets the stage for intense competition in the domestic market, with coal
being challenged by low-emissions sources that are an increasingly important source of
economic growth and employment. In today’s complicated geopolitical environment, with
plenty of domestic coal and fast-growing clean energy sources, it is not obvious that Chinese
conditions will allow for rapid expansion of an imported fuel. It is worth noting in this context
that the possibility, albeit still a distant one, of China concluding an additional gas supply
52

contract with Russia for the Power of Siberia-2 pipeline represents a major wild card for the
LNG industry, as this would significantly increase the global glut of LNG.
Accelerated climate action – as seen in the APS and NZE Scenario – would also create an even
larger surplus of LNG in the coming years. In the APS, LNG export plant utilisation rates fall
to 70% in 2030, and existing LNG projects together with those under construction are able
to fulfil LNG demand all the way through to 2050. In the NZE Scenario, utilisation rates fall to
less than 60% in 2030 and LNG demand through to 2050 can be met entirely by projects
existing today. In this latter scenario, we estimate that the sponsors of around 70% of LNG
export projects currently under construction would struggle to recover their invested capital.
Gas prices are higher in the APS, but there are still some 80 bcm of projects, or 30% of what
is currently under construction, which would not fully recover their invested capital.
Nonetheless, markets typically find ways to clear, and it is therefore worth examining the
conditions under which natural gas demand growth could be more robust. The 2010s –
heralded by the IEA in a 2011 report as a potential “golden age for gas” – saw natural gas
demand grow on average by around 2.7% per year, and it has in addition increased by 1.2%
per year on average over the past five years (IEA, 2011). In the STEPS, natural gas demand
peaks before 2030 and declines throughout the 2030s, mainly due to the rapid deployment
of renewables, heat pumps and other efficiency measures. But clean energy technologies
could be adopted at a slower pace and scale than seen in the STEPS, and alongside other
factors, this could lead to natural gas demand continuing to rise throughout the 2030s and
beyond (Box 1.6).
Box 1.6 ⊳

Could natural gas demand keep growing into the 2030s
and beyond?

If natural gas were to keep growing at the pace seen over the past five years, demand
would rise to around 5 200 bcm in 2040, or nearly 850 bcm higher than in the STEPS
(Figure 1.20). The sorts of changes that, taken together, could enable natural gas demand
to increase to this level by 2040 include:

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Higher electricity demand: Global electricity demand increases by 2.9% on average each
year between 2023 and 2040 in the STEPS. Failure to implement efficiency measures in
buildings, appliances and industry at the scale projected in the STEPS could increase
demand by an additional one-half percentage point per year. If gas-fired power plants
were to meet the same share of electricity generation as they do today, this would mean
an additional 100 bcm of gas demand in 2040.
Higher demand in industry: Energy demand in industry increases by 1% on average per
year between 2023 and 2040 in the STEPS. A slowdown in efficiency and less
electrification could mean total industry energy demand increases by an additional half
percentage point, closer to average growth rates over the past five years. If natural gas
were to meet the same share of industry demand as it does today, overall consumption
would be around 90 bcm higher than in the STEPS by 2040.
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

Coal-to-gas switching: The technical potential for coal-to-gas switching in the power
sector is around 450 bcm today. In the STEPS, this potential progressively diminishes as
coal plants retire and their output is replaced by clean electricity. If natural gas prices
were to fall low enough, however, an additional 300 bcm above the level of the potential
assumed in the STEPS would be opened to possible switching, primarily in China, India
and Southeast Asia.
Wind and solar PV: Around 550 GW of solar PV and wind capacity were installed in 2023,
and annual additions expand to over 800 GW in the STEPS by 2040. If capacity additions
were to remain at current levels instead, this would imply 250 bcm of additional gas
demand in 2040 above the level of the STEPS on the basis of the current power mix.
Building retrofit rates: Close to 20% of the building stock in advanced economies
undergoes refurbishment in the STEPS to 2040. If retrofit rates were instead held at the
2023 level of around 1%, overall gas demand in 2040 would be around 60 bcm higher
than in the STEPS.
Heat pumps: Around 110 GW of heat pumps were installed in 2023, and this increases to
300 GW by 2040 in the STEPS. If heat pump additions were to remain at 2023 levels,
natural gas demand would be around 40 bcm higher in 2040 than in the STEPS.

Continued increase in gas demand cannot be ruled out, but it would take a major
slowdown in clean technology deployment and efficiency improvements

Natural gas can also provide flexibility to integrate variable renewables, and this is often
highlighted as a reason for its enduring role in transitions. But this role requires limited
amounts of natural gas, and certainly much less than what is required by power plants in
order to provide bulk electricity.
54

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

More favourable long-term circumstances for growth in natural gas demand cannot be
ruled out, but they depend on a combination of policy settings, technology developments
and market trends that lead to a major slowdown in the deployment of clean energy
technologies and in the achievement of efficiency gains, and on LNG being priced for
some years at levels that makes it difficult for exporters to recover their costs. Further
sensitivities related to natural gas demand are explored in Chapter 4.

What will it take to achieve energy access goals
by 2030?

Reaching universal access to electricity and clean cooking is central to a just, people-centred
energy transition. The deployment of ever more innovative, efficient and sustainable
solutions has widened the range of options now available to achieve that goal while
improving the quality of life of millions and reducing the impact on the environment.
Since the early 2000s, many countries have made rapid progress to extend energy access,
led by developing economies in Asia and parts of Latin America (Figure 1.21). Other
countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, have struggled to keep up with population
growth. As part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda, UN members in
2015 agreed to the goal of providing affordable, reliable and modern energy to all by 2030
(SDG7.1) – a goal that is achieved in the NZE Scenario.

IEA tracking shows that, even before the Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis, a
major boost in progress was needed to deliver this goal. Recent years have seen progress
slow and even go into reverse in some cases, intensifying the pressure on countries that were
already facing a difficult outlook. This raises the question of whether the 2030 goal is slipping
out of reach.
Yet, there are reasons for guarded optimism. A range of innovative energy access solutions
is renewing momentum and helping to bring about faster progress in some regions. In
addition, a flurry of new policies and national plans have markedly improved the longer-term
outlook. This section explores how energy access progresses under current policy settings,
and where accelerated action is needed.

1.7.1

Access to electricity

Progress on electricity access has been remarkable in the past decades: since 2000, the world
has reduced the number of people without electricity access by 925 million, and 40 countries
have reached at least near universal access to electricity. But around 750 million people still
lack access to electricity, and progress has been uneven, with only one-in-five of the people
gaining access to electricity in this period living in Africa. As many Asian countries near
universal access, attention is increasingly turning to Africa, where it has proved more difficult
to regain momentum amid the lingering effects of the crisis years, including high debt levels
in many countries.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

While grid connections in some countries are gradually resuming, some of this slowdown is
being offset by new business models such as Pay-As-You-Go solar PV (PAYGo) and digital
payment systems, and by the decreasing cost of batteries and solar PV modules. Sales of
solar home systems (SHS) have increased 2.5-fold in sub-Saharan Africa since 2018, and more
than 90% of all the systems sold worldwide in 2023 were sold through PAYGo (GOGLA, 2024).
The latest IEA estimates suggest that over 40 million people in sub-Saharan Africa had access
to electricity via SHS in 2023, which is almost four-times more than five years before. An
additional 30 million people in the region use SHS as a backup source of electricity, especially
in places where the grid electricity supply tends to be unreliable. Innovative models like
Energy as a Service are showing the potential to make SHS affordable even for the poorest
and most remote populations (GET.Invest, 2024). In addition, around 48 million people
globally benefited from a mini-grid connection in 2021, around 27 million of which are in subSaharan Africa (ESMAP, 2022). Recent analysis indicates that 2024 might be the fastest year
on record for new mini-grid connections (Mini-Grids Partnership, 2024). A crucial ingredient
for successful projects is a link to local productive uses as they underpin revenue and
bankability and can lead to significant local economic benefits in the longer term (IEA, 2023).
While technological improvements and innovative models are helping, they will not by
themselves achieve the scale needed to reach universal access and overcome the current
affordability gap. Public interventions and targeted incentives are required if 120 million
people are to gain access each year, as they must do to achieve the SDG 7.1 goal by 2030
56

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

(Figure 1.22). Most of the progress needs to take place in sub-Saharan Africa, where around
7% of the population has to gain access each year to get on track. This pace of annual
progress is not unprecedented, with comparable and higher percentages having been
achieved in the past in Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and India. In 2018, India
connected almost 100 million people – equivalent to the annual effort required in subSaharan Africa to close the gap by 2030 – thanks to government initiatives aimed at
expanding rural electrification, such as the Saubhagya and the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram
Jyoti Yojana schemes.

Around one-third of the population without access to electricity, about 250 million people,
live in countries where new and improved access policies and programmes have been
initiated, including six countries where previous policies were expected to lead to very
limited improvements. New international financing commitments are helping draw policy
attention to countries with large access gaps. However, there will still be around 650 million
people without access to electricity by 2030 in the STEPS. More concrete measures are
needed to boost progress.

Access to clean cooking

Since 2000, around 1 billion people have gained access to clean cooking, and 16 countries
have reached near universal access. Progress has been concentrated in Asia and Latin
America. In much of Africa, population growth has continued to outpace improvements in
access. There is much further to go. Today, more than 2 billion people still lack access to
clean cooking, split almost equally between sub-Saharan Africa and developing economies in
Asia.

Within reach = population in countries where fundamental policies are in place, but additional efforts are

Among the main obstacles to further progress are affordability and limited clean cooking
policies and programmes. Countries that have recently implemented or strengthened clean
cooking policies have often seen rapid progress, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas.
The majority of progress so far has been achieved through the provision of LPG stoves and
cylinders, and improved solid biomass stoves. Other clean cooking fuels are proving capable
of being rapidly scaled up in certain locations, notably bioethanol, biogas and electric
58

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

cooking. Bioethanol cooking has grown strongly on the back of carbon credit revenues in
Kenya and has the potential to expand quickly in urban and peri-urban areas in East Africa.
Efficiency induction and hyper-efficient electric pressure cookers are also starting to make
headway in Asia, often supported by government-led campaigns to reduce LPG imports.
Access to clean cooking has gained substantial political attention in recent years, prompting
a wave of new domestic and international efforts to improve access. Around 630 million
people without clean cooking access live in countries in which new and improved policy
frameworks were implemented in the last two years or are under active development
(Figure 1.23). This includes new national clean cooking strategies and plans in Kenya, Nigeria,
Tanzania and Uganda. Support from the G7, G20, and the Conference of the Parties (COP)
presidencies as well as from international finance institutions helped to move the dial. While
this has improved the outlook for clean cooking since the WEO-2023, around 1.7 billion
people still lack access to clean cooking by 2030 in the STEPS. Transitional solutions like
improved biomass cookstoves (ISO Tier >=3) could provide prompt and meaningful benefits
for remote and poor households in the short term before more sustainable longer-term
solutions and infrastructure can be put in place.

1.7.3

Investment needs to ramp up quickly

To achieve universal energy access by 2030, around USD 55 billion in upfront investment is
needed each year, around two-thirds of which is required in sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1.24).
This is less than 2% of current annual energy spending. Current investment levels are just
below USD 10 billion annually. This is much less than is needed and has decreased around
75% from pre-COVID19 levels. However, the decrease is due in part to large economies
having made rapid progress in the intervening years and achieving near universal access to
electricity.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Affordability constraints mean that private capital can only cover a small share of the
financing that is needed for energy access, while African governments already face rising
debt sustainability concerns. This means that the allocation of official development
assistance to energy in Africa is vitally important if faster progress is to be made, but the level
of such assistance for energy projects has remained static over the past decade. Without a
stronger international commitment to universal energy access, there is a risk that many
developing economies may be left behind. The new collective quantified goal on climate
finance could be used as a vehicle to close at least part of the funding gap.
Renewed attention to energy access issues within international climate finance and
development assistance is already providing a boost to concessional capital for access. The
“Mission 300” programme, which aims to provide 300 million people with electricity access,
has received initial pledges of USD 30 billion and aims to reach around USD 90 billion. An
additional USD 2.2 billion of private and public sector finance for clean cooking was pledged
at the IEA Summit for Clean Cooking in Africa in May 2024, on top of the USD 2 billion
committed by the African Development Bank at the COP28.

Implementing these commitments remains a challenge. The small size of projects, especially
for clean cooking and rural off-grid electrification, and the lack of established private sector
players in some locations, make it more difficult to disburse money fast and effectively. On
top of this, household affordability constraints, evolving pricing regulation and a lack of
credible benchmarks increase the real and perceived risks for energy access projects. Plans
to improve electricity access are more likely to attract support and to succeed if they identify
productive uses and anchor loads, e.g. small industries, agricultural pumps, communication
towers, and if they lead to the displacement of diesel and petrol generators. Targeting
institutional facilities and peri-urban areas has proved to be successful to extend access to
clean cooking while creating momentum.
Recent shifts in the use of concessional finance such as guarantees and first-loss capital are
helping to attract rising levels of private capital. The share of private finance in both
electricity and clean cooking access projects neared 50% in 2019, up from 30% for electricity
in 2013, and from less than 10% for clean cooking. The availability of commercial private
capital is expected to continue to rise but is likely to focus on more profitable projects, such
as those in urban and high demand areas. Public and concessional finance remains
fundamental to reach poor and more remote areas. Carbon market financing for clean
cooking projects has also been on the rise, with over 40 million credits issued in 2023,
60

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

accounting for 15% of all carbon credits issued globally and up ten-times from 2013.
Concerns about the rigour of cookstoves credits have hampered the market, but new
initiatives and methodologies, notably the CLEAR 2 methodology, aim to meet those
concerns.
Despite the progress that is being made, the goal of universal access cannot be delivered
without improved policies and an increase in funding support, particularly in Africa. Calls for
more climate finance need to be heeded, and to be accompanied by continued efforts to
ramp up private sector involvement. All of this ultimately depends on unwavering
commitment to achieve universal access on the part of the governments of the countries
where progress is needed, together with strengthened commitment on the part of the
international community, including international financial institutions.

How to scale up clean energy investment in emerging
market and developing economies?

Global energy sector investment reached around USD 2.9 trillion in 2023 and is likely to
exceed USD 3 trillion for the first time in 2024, with almost USD 2 invested in a range of clean
energy technologies and infrastructure for every USD 1 spent on fossil fuels. Prior to the
Covid-19 pandemic, this ratio was closer to 1:1. Global investment in clean energy has
increased by 60% since 2015, driven not only by emissions reduction goals, but also by robust
underlying economics, considerations of energy security during a period of extreme volatility
in fossil fuel prices, and competition among leading economies for positions in the new clean
energy economy that will be an important source of growth and employment in the coming
years.
Recent increases in clean energy investment come mostly from advanced economies and
China, making up 85% of the total, while other emerging market and developing economies,
home to two-thirds of the global population, account for just 15% (Figure 1.25). This
misalignment is a major concern, given that demand for energy services in developing
economies will inevitably increase in the coming years to support rising standards of living,
universal access to energy and construction of modern infrastructure. The high cost of capital
and lack of affordable long-term financing is a key contributor to these regional imbalances
and an impediment to increasing capital flows to emerging market and developing
economies in the future.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Investment in clean energy projects increase in all parts of the world in the NZE Scenario, but
the regional imbalances mean that the required increase is particularly steep in emerging
market and developing economies other than China. In the NZE Scenario, annual spending
on clean energy doubles in advanced economies and in China by 2035 compared with 2023
levels, while it grows more than six-fold in other developing economies (Figure 1.26).

Breaking down investment requirements

The surge in clean energy spending that is required in both the APS and NZE scenario can
appear daunting for emerging market and developing economies (Figure 1.27). But many
examples show that a clear vision for energy transitions, supported by sound policies,
regulations and private sector engagement, can drive growth in both the quantity and quality
of clean energy investments. And the benefits of these investments go well beyond
mitigating climate change (Box 1.7). Many clean energy facilities, once installed, tend to have
lower operating costs than fossil fuel facilities, and are not financially exposed to volatile fuel
costs. This can bring major long-term energy and economic security gains especially for
economies highly dependent on fuel imports.

Closing the clean energy investment gap in developing economies requires mobilising capital
and channelling it to sectors that present different degrees and types of risks to investors.
For instance, the challenges and business models that are relevant to a utility-scale solar PV
project with a long-term contract are different from those that arise in connection with a
transmission line financed on balance sheet by a state-owned utility, or an electric car that
is paid for by a household with consumer finance or their own savings. Risks can also vary for
different projects within a single sector and for similar projects in different countries, since
factors like political and macroeconomic stability and the rule of law have broad
consequences for risk perceptions and therefore also for the cost of capital.

Multiple benefits of clean energy investment

To think of clean energy projects only in terms of their role in tackling climate change is
to miss the broader picture. In many cases, these projects also offer the prospect of
cheaper energy, efficiency gains and important co-benefits in terms of air quality, water
use and employment.
Air quality is a particular concern as it accounts for over 4.5 million premature deaths
worldwide each year due to ambient (outdoor) air pollution, and nearly 3 million deaths
from household air pollution, primarily as a result of the use of traditional fuels and
stoves for cooking. Nearly all these premature deaths are in emerging market and
developing countries. In the NZE Scenario, efforts to achieve universal energy access
through scaling up clean energy investment lead to a 40% decrease in premature deaths
from ambient air pollution by 2030, and a 90% drop in premature deaths from indoor
pollution (Figure 1.28).

Scaling up clean energy helps countries reduce premature deaths from air pollution
and water needs for energy operations while generating employment

Replacing thermal generation with renewable sources like wind and solar PV also results
in large reductions in water use. In addition, the deployment of clean energy brings net
gains in employment as demand increases for construction, manufacturing, installation
and maintenance projects. Developing a skilled labour pool is vital for countries looking
to be competitive in new clean energy industries, as is attracting more women to work
in energy-related fields: women currently represent just 15% of the energy workforce.

64

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

The prospects for scaling up clean energy investment in all sectors depend to a large extent
on policy certainty, data reliability and strong governance. Making improvements in these
areas is therefore critically important. This needs to be accompanied and facilitated by
significant increases in international public financial and technical support, including larger
volumes of concessional funding to bring in much higher multiples of private capital. By 2030
in the NZE Scenario, annual concessional funding for the energy sector triples to reach over
USD 100 billion in developing economies other than China.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

However, not all projects need public financial support. In considering how to scale up
investment, it is useful to break down the overall requirement into categories that reflect
particular characteristics and risk profiles. In work undertaken in support of the Brazilian
G20 presidency in 2024, the following three groupings were proposed:


The first group covers investment in mature clean energy technologies with relatively
low risk and strong underlying economics in countries with relatively good credit rating.
These can usually be privately led, provided that investors have confidence in the
quality of the policy and regulatory environment. For example, utility-scale solar PV and
wind projects in Brazil or in India have built up a successful track record of mobilising
private capital for several years, and only limited interventions are required on the
financing side from the public sector. In the NZE Scenario, the total clean energy
investment requirement in developing economies other than China in 2035 is around
USD 1.8 trillion, and our assessment is that around 40% of the investment falls into this
privately led category.



The second group of projects, accounting for around half of the 2035 clean energy
requirement in the NZE Scenario, needs to be facilitated by some form of risk mitigation
based on collaboration between the public and private sectors. These facilitated
interventions cover technologies that have reached commercial maturity in some
markets but have yet to take off in a specific developing economy, for example a utilityscale solar PV in a nascent market like Cambodia, and emerging technologies in
relatively low risk jurisdictions that require additional support for the first commercial
scale projects, for example a low-emissions hydrogen project in Chile. They also cover
projects where the national creditworthiness is low and a constraint on investors, or
where significant social returns, such as those arising from improved energy access,
need some form of public support to ensure affordability and bankability.



The third group, accounting for around 6% of projects, concerns investment for which
commercial capital is either not available or is too costly to access because the real and
perceived risks are very high. These investments need to be publicly driven. They
include projects in some of the least developed countries in the world, and projects in
countries involved in or emerging from conflicts, as well as those involving some nascent
technologies or aspects of public infrastructure that require substantial public support
to lower costs.

These three categories help to differentiate the types and scale of finance that may be
required to advance clean energy transitions in emerging market and developing economies,
Chapter 1 | Overview and key findings

65

and to provide a means of identifying the cases that require additional support from public
financial institutions, including the strategic use of concessional financing to bring in much
larger volumes of private capital.

1.8.2

Challenge of scale

Facilitated interventions need to be designed in ways that not only help individual projects
to move ahead but also clear the path for more projects to follow without the same level of
support. Concessional funding is scarce and needs to be deployed in ways that allow its
impact to be sustained even when the funding itself is withdrawn. In essence this means
helping projects to move to a point where they can be led by the private sector. The key to
this is to consider reforms that address underlying barriers as part of the process of designing
and implementing interventions, and to standardise, to the extent possible, the underlying
documentation, e.g. for power purchase agreements.
Scaling up clean energy requires integrated policy approaches and system-wide planning. In
the power sector, for example, bringing in new sources of generation, especially variable
ones like solar PV and wind, requires the flexible operation of other generation assets and
measures to expand and modernise grids and storage. In countries with large coal-fired
power generation fleets, this means repurposing coal plants to provide balancing services,
or making provisions for early plant retirements to allow clean sources to expand, prioritising
the retirement of older, less efficient units. It also means full recognition of the importance
of demand-side measures and energy efficiency.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Scaling up also means identifying and developing new sources of finance. For the moment,
domestic sources of capital account for most of the financing for clean energy investment
projects in developing economies. This finding is heavily conditioned by the weight of China
in the overall numbers, as more than 90% of clean energy projects in China are funded by
domestic sources. But domestic funding has also been crucial in other developing economies
that have successfully scaled up clean energy investment, including India and South Africa.
Deeper local capital markets in other jurisdictions can help finance flow to projects in clean
energy, while developing secondary markets from operating assets with stable revenue
streams can also help recycle capital into new projects.
The volume of investment required for successful clean energy transitions therefore
necessitates a greater role for international capital. As an example, developing economies
other than China see a sharp increase in capital flows from international sources, from 20%
in 2023 to 35% in the NZE Scenario in 2035. Financing instruments such as green, social,
sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds have the potential to mobilise private capital at
scale by attracting institutional investors that do not typically invest in individual projects.
Project aggregation platforms and securitisation vehicles are also necessary to overcome the
asymmetry between the relatively small size of most clean energy projects, especially in the
end use sector, in developing economies and the comparatively large minimum investment
size that institutional investors typically require.

S U M M A R Y
• Total global energy demand rose by around 2% in 2023, with declines in advanced
economies more than offset by large increases in emerging market and developing
economies. A record high level of clean energy came online globally, including more
than 560 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable power capacity. Around USD 2 trillion is
expected to be invested in clean energy in 2024, almost double the amount invested
in fossil fuels. However, two-thirds of the overall increase in energy demand in 2023
was met by fossil fuels and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached a
record high.

• Governments cumulatively earmarked USD 2 trillion of financial support for clean
energy between 2020 and mid-2024. They also spent around USD 940 billion on
support for consumer energy affordability during the global energy crisis, though
most of the measures put in place to provide that support have now expired.

• Many new energy policies, spending plans and regulations have been introduced or
announced since the Outlook in 2023. Countries are now putting more emphasis on
building domestic clean technology manufacturing capacity to improve energy
security and boost economic activity, including through tying support to domestic
production or jobs and through trade measures. Since 2020, nearly 200 trade
measures affecting clean energy technologies have been introduced.

• This Outlook examines three main long-term scenarios – none of which are forecasts –
to provide a framework for understanding possible energy futures. Policies are the
critical differentiator between them. We also explore a number of sensitivity cases
related to uncertainties in the pace of clean energy deployment, natural gas markets
and electricity demand, and the wider implications these have for energy and
emissions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, broader
geopolitical tensions, and elections in countries accounting for half of global energy
demand today mean a very high level of uncertainty over the projections in this
Outlook.

• In this Outlook, the global economy increases by 2.7% on average each year to 2050.
We maintain a constant economic growth rate across all scenarios to facilitate a
comparison of the impacts of energy and climate choices with a consistent backdrop.
The global population expands from 8 billion today to 9.7 billion in 2050, an annual
average growth rate that is around half the rate seen between 1990 and 2023.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Prices for fossil fuels and critical minerals have fallen from the very high levels in 2022.
Future price changes are assumed to follow smooth trajectories in all scenarios, but
there remains an ever-present risk of volatility.

Context for the World Energy Outlook-2024

The World Energy Outlook-2024 unfolds against a complex and uncertain backdrop. The
immediate impact of the shocks from the Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis
spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are diminishing, but the damage to public finances
and to international co-operation will take longer to repair. Countries representing half of
global energy demand are voting in national or regional elections in 2024; climate and
energy-related issues feature prominently in many campaigns. The spectre of spiralling
conflicts across the Middle East also highlights key energy security risks in the current system,
while decades of accumulated emissions are accentuating the risks from extreme weather.
Today’s broad trends underscore the urgency of transforming the energy sector even as they
also complicate its achievement in practice. In these circumstances, the continued
momentum and resilience of clean energy transitions is remarkable. Since 2020, investment
in clean energy technologies and infrastructure has increased by 60%; the amount of capital
invested each year to support clean energy projects is now twice the amount invested in
fossil fuels. This is boosting the contribution that clean energy makes to the global energy
mix, even though the majority of growth in global energy demand is currently still being met
by fossil fuels.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The extent and speed of structural changes in the energy sector and their implications for
energy security, affordability and emissions are central themes in this Outlook. Our scenario
analysis is designed to inform decision makers as they consider options, not to predict how
they will act, and none of the scenarios should be viewed as a forecast. The scenarios, all of
which look out to 2050, are:


Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS): This scenario provides a sense of the prevailing
direction of travel for the energy system, based on a detailed assessment of current
policy settings. Chapter 4 explores a number of sensitivity cases related to clean energy
deployment, natural gas markets and electricity demand, and to assess the wider
implications these have for energy and emissions.



Announced Pledges Scenario (APS): This scenario outlines a trajectory for the energy
sector if all national energy and climate pledges, including long-term net zero emissions
goals, are met on time and in full.



Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario: This scenario portrays a pathway in which
the energy sector achieves net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally by 2050, in
line with limiting the long-term global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C),
along with achieving universal energy access by 2030 and air quality objectives.

This chapter sets the scene for subsequent analyses by outlining the current context for
energy use and emissions, broad macroeconomic and investment trends, and policy and
geopolitical uncertainties. It then goes into more detail on the scenarios used in this Outlook,
discussing how and why they differ from each other, the underlying policy, economic and
demographic drivers, energy and carbon prices, and technology costs.

Recent trends in energy demand and CO2 emissions

Following an increase of 8 exajoules (EJ) in 2022, global energy demand increased by around
13 EJ in 2023, pushing up global demand by 2%. This reflects a growing requirement for
energy in emerging market and developing economies which more than cancelled out a fall
in energy demand in advanced economies of around 2%. There was a large increase in both
oil and coal use globally, and two-thirds of the total increase in energy demand in 2023 was
met by fossil fuels (Figure 2.1).

Fossil fuels met two-thirds of the increase in global energy demand in 2023, mostly with
more coal and oil, while the increase in clean energy in 2023 was twice as large as in 2022
Note: EJ = exajoule.

Global oil demand increased by 2 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 to 99 mb/d. This
increase was nearly double the average annual increase between 2010 and 2019 and was led
by increases in oil use as a petrochemical feedstock in China – where total oil demand
increased by 1.5 mb/d – and by continued global growth in oil demand in the transport
sector. Demand in advanced economies fell by around 0.3 mb/d. Oil demand trends in 2024
show a sharp slowdown in demand growth, notably in China, which is expected to result in
an overall rise for the year of less than 1 mb/d.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global coal demand increased by just over 100 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in
2023 to around 6 000 Mtce, mainly because of increased use in the power sector in China
and India. 1 Demand in advanced economies fell by more than 120 Mtce, about 10%, with
1 Historical coal data has been revised in this edition of World Energy Outlook as new information became
available. For example, global coal demand in 2022 was revised upwards by 70 Mtce (1.3%), mainly because
of increases in China and in the power sectors of Indonesia and India.

70

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

coal use in the United States and European Union power sectors dropping by 20-25%.
Demand in 2024 is expected to be slightly higher than in 2023 as strong electricity demand
in China and India result in higher coal demand that more than offsets continued cuts in coal
use in the European Union.
Natural gas demand worldwide rose by 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2023 to 4 190 bcm.
There were large increases in demand in the power sector in North America and in the
buildings and industry sectors in the Middle East. These were partially offset by a 40 bcm
decline in Europe, which reduced its natural gas demand by around 7% in 2023. This follows
a reduction of 13% in 2022 and means that gas demand in Europe is now at its lowest level
since the early 1990s. Preliminary data suggest that global natural gas demand increased by
50 bcm in the first-half of 2024, mainly as a result of increases in natural gas use in the
industry and power sectors in Asia.
Total energy supply from low-emissions sources of energy reached a record high in 2023, led
by increases in China and Europe. In the electricity sector, more than 560 gigawatts (GW) of
new renewable power capacity were added in 2023, accounting for around 80% of total new
power sector capacity additions worldwide. China alone added more than 350 GW of new
renewables capacity, and its renewable generation increased by 235 terawatt-hours (TWh),
which is similar to the total amount of renewable electricity generated in Japan in 2023.
Liquid biofuels supply increased by 7% in 2023 to 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day
(mboe/d), mainly because of new renewable diesel refining capacity in the United States and
new bioethanol capacity in Brazil. The supply of biomethane, an upgraded form of biogas,
rose by 10% in 2023 to around 10 bcm reflecting enhanced policy support in Europe and the
United States. Nuclear generation rose by 3%, in large part due to the restart of some existing
reactors in Japan.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The energy intensity of the global economy improved by around 1% in 2023, following a 2%
decline in 2022, meaning that the efficiency with which the global economy uses energy is
continuing to make progress. In the European Union, energy intensity improved by 5% in
2023 as measures put in place to tackle the energy crisis continued to drive down energy use
and as energy-intensive industrial output declined. Globally, the share of total car sales
accounted for by plug-in hybrid and battery electric models rose from 14% in 2022 to 18% in
2023 and is set to rise above 20% in 2024. Around 60% of all electric car sales in 2023 were
in China. The number of heat pumps installed around the world fell slightly in 2023 as
concerns around high natural gas prices eased and consumers continued to face harsh
economic conditions.
The energy sector is responsible for around 85% of total global CO2 emissions; energy-related
CO2 emissions rose by 1.3% in 2023 to a record high of 37.7 gigatonnes (Gt) (Figure 2.2).
Emissions from coal drove most of the increase. Energy-related CO2 emissions were about
1 Gt higher in 2023 than in 2019. The world has clearly not yet turned the corner on
emissions. Nevertheless, the clean energy economy is having an effect: the increase in
emissions since 2019 would have been three-times as large without the expanding
deployment of clean energy technologies (IEA, 2024a).

The hottest year in recorded history was 2023. Temperatures by mid-2024 suggest that this
record is highly likely to be broken again. The 12-month period to May 2024 saw 76 extreme
heat events worldwide, with damaging consequences for infrastructure, healthcare services,
vulnerable populations and the natural environment (Climate Central, Red Cross Red
Crescent, and Climate Centre World Weather Attribution, 2024; Berkeley Earth, 2024b;
WMO, 2024a).
Although it is not yet possible to be certain, the 12-month period from July 2023 to June 2024
may have seen global average surface temperatures of 1.5 °C higher than pre-industrial
levels (C3S, 2024), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) declared an
approximately 50% chance that the temperature rise will exceed 1.5 °C on average over the
2024-2028 period (WMO, 2024b). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
warns that the severity of the impacts of global warming are expected to escalate
dramatically if the temperature rise does go above 1.5 °C. However, the 1.5 °C threshold, as
set out in the Paris Agreement, applies to long-term warming, rather than single year or
short-term periods, which are strongly affected by natural weather variability. The IPCC often
uses an averaging period of 20 years to remove the impact of natural variability when
considering whether a given warming level has been crossed. Even if the temperature rise
exceeds 1.5 °C for a short period, the temperature rise can be brought back below 1.5 °C with
concerted long-term action (IPCC, 2023).

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

2.1.2

Macroeconomic context

Following a prolonged period of exceptionally low interest rates and inflation in the 2010s,
the macroeconomic context was significantly changed in the space of a few years by the
Covid-19 pandemic and the global energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To
combat the rising inflation that emerged as the landscape changed, central banks
progressively tightened their monetary policy, which led to the steepest interest rate
increases seen in decades. Advanced economies raised rates by an average of 290 basis
points (2.9%) in 2023 over the average level in 2022 and emerging market and developing
economies by 150 basis points (1.5%). Inflation has eased in most regions so far in 2024 and
there have been interest rates cuts in a number of countries, particularly in advanced
economies. However, inflation and interest rates currently are still much higher than they
have been over the past 15 years in most economies. Inflation remains a particular problem
in a number of emerging market and developing economies, including Brazil, India and South
Africa, and interest rate cuts there are likely to be slower.
The energy crisis clearly showed the role that energy prices can play in inflation, with price
spikes contributing approximately one-third of the increase in headline inflation between
2021-2023 (Figure 2.3). The driver was not clean energy; it was spikes in the prices of oil,
natural gas and coal after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and cuts in Russian gas supply to
Europe (IEA, 2022).

Increases in energy prices, whether from temporary spikes or more structural changes, have
a major impact on household bills. In both advanced and emerging market and developing
economies, the median household spends around 10% of their disposable income on
residential energy and transport fuels. Direct consumption of oil, electricity and gas in
emerging market and developing economies is only one-third of the level in advanced
economies, but disposable income is also much lower. Oil currently accounts for around half
of total consumer energy expenditure worldwide, meaning that oil price volatility has a
particularly significant impact on consumer energy expenditure. 2
There are several near-term downside risks for global economic growth. In 2024 and 2025
growth is expected to be lower than the 2010-2019 average in countries comprising more
than 80% of global output and population (World Bank, 2024). High debt levels and interest
rates in many economies are likely to squeeze government spending, potentially delaying or
decreasing investment in energy infrastructure. They are also likely to reduce household
spending, which could lead to a slowdown of the economy and higher unemployment.
Further macroeconomic risks include trade fragmentation as well as geopolitical and policy
uncertainty (section 2.1.3).
The economic slowdown is pronounced in emerging market and developing economies:
nearly 60% of the growth forecasts for these economies made by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) in April 2024 are lower than the forecasts made in April 2023 (IMF, 2024 and IMF,
2023) and their aggregate rate of economic growth is expected to slow from 4.2% in 2023 to
4% in 2024 (World Bank, 2024). Per capita income growth is set to average just 3% through
to 2026, below the 2010-2019 average of 3.3%, and many emerging market and developing
economies are now unlikely to see any relative economic catch-up with advanced economies
in the near term. This slowdown puts recent progress on poverty reduction at risk of stalling
or reversing.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

These imbalances are also reflected in flows of capital to clean energy projects (Figure 2.4).
Global clean energy investment has increased rapidly over the last five years, but nearly all
of the increase has been in advanced economies and China, with China accounting for an
especially large share of spending relative to its gross domestic product (GDP). Increasing
capital flows to clean energy projects in other emerging market and developing economies
will be essential to meet their rapidly rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way
and to support economic growth. However, involvement of private capital in many of these
countries is still limited and faces a variety of headwinds. The higher interest rate
environment has pushed up financing costs, and expected levels of returns on investment
are impacted by higher real and perceived risks of new clean energy projects in these
markets.

2 Further discussion on the impact of energy costs across different income levels is in the WEO Special Report:

Political and geopolitical uncertainties

A major reason for the uncertain political context is the large number of elections that have
been or are being held in 2024 around the world, which affect the population in over
80 countries that account for half of global energy demand (Figure 2.5). The global energy
crisis put energy and other pressures on the cost of living at the heart of many voter
concerns. The prominence of energy-related issues in many campaigns suggests that
elections could bring some changes in emphasis and direction for energy policies. In some
cases, these could reinforce the momentum behind clean energy transitions; in others, they
could lead to a slower pace of change. In the meantime, uncertainty may deter energy
investment, particularly in large-scale projects in new or emerging technologies that are
particularly sensitive to policy and regulatory changes (section 2.2.1).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Energy markets also remain vulnerable to geopolitical events. The initial price shocks from
the global energy crisis and the Russian invasion of Ukraine abated during the first-quarter
of 2024 as natural gas prices dropped to slightly above pre-crisis levels, though prices remain
above their 2023 levels across the main Asian and European markets due to a combination
of robust demand and short-term constraints on liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply. Further
shocks arising from the continuing war in Ukraine cannot be ruled out.
There are other geopolitical tensions that could trigger disruption and price shocks in energy
markets. There are particularly high risks in the Middle East with the spectre of spiralling
regional hostilities, as well as attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Since 2021, Europe, Japan
and Korea have taken an increased share of their oil imports from the Middle East in the
Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

75

wake of sanctions imposed on Russia, and China has seen a similar trend (Figure 2.6). Imports
of Russian oil to India increased from 2% of total oil imports in 2021 to 35% in 2023. For the
moment, these geopolitical risks have not been reflected in prices, but a broader regional
conflict could have major implications for oil and natural gas markets. More than 20 mb/d of
oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, 75% of which goes to Asia, and a further 7.5 mb/d
of oil passes through the Suez Canal. Annual flows of LNG through the Strait of Hormuz are
more than 100 bcm, nearly 80% of which is delivered to Asian markets.

Clean energy supply chains are also subject to geopolitical tensions. At present, China
produces more than 80% of the world’s battery cells and solar photovoltaic (PV) modules,
and 65% of wind nacelles (Figure 2.7). It dominates the midstream refining and processing of
critical minerals, accounting for 65% of global processing for lithium and over 75% for cobalt
and nearly all the graphite anode supply chain. China currently produces two-thirds of the
world's electric vehicles (EVs). Investment in these areas has picked up in the United States,
European Union, India and elsewhere, and China’s share in global EV sales slipped from 70%
in 2022 to 65% in 2023, but it is still very large. Consumers around the world have benefited
from the reductions in technology costs that large-scale supply chain investment has
brought. Nonetheless, such a high degree of concentration presents risks. If disruptions were
to occur, the nature and severity of its effects might well depend on whether it resulted from
geopolitical issues, extreme weather or industrial accidents.

Many countries are seeking to promote more diverse patterns of investment and
manufacturing in clean energy supply, including for critical minerals. This has resulted in a
marked increase in the number of trade policies and other measures focussed on clean
energy technologies since 2020. 3 Tariff adjustments, antidumping duties and countervailing
measures are at the centre of the most recent trade policies. For example, several regions,
such as the United States and European Union, have announced additional duties on solar
PV, EVs and batteries from China. There have also been revisions to import tariffs on some
clean energy technologies and components in Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, India, Mexico,
Türkiye and United States. While these could lead to more diversified supplies, a balance is
required that also recognises the value of clean energy equipment and mineral trade to clean
energy transitions.

2.2

WEO scenarios

The World Energy Outlook (WEO) analyses provide a framework for understanding the future
of energy by examining different potential scenarios for its development. Each scenario has
the same starting point and incorporates the latest data for energy supply and demand,
markets, technology costs and policies, and also similar levels of future population and
economic growth. None of these scenarios is a forecast.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The energy system described in each scenario evolves in a distinctive pathway that delivers
energy services with a different mix of technologies and fuels, and with varying implications
for energy security, affordability and emissions. This is mainly due to variations in the
assumptions made about how government policies develop, and how these variations affect
the investment and technology choices made by households and firms.


Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS): This scenario provides a sense of the prevailing
direction of travel for the energy sector based on a detailed reading of the latest policy
settings in countries around the world. It accounts for energy, climate and related
industrial policies that are in place or that have been announced. The aims of these
policies are not automatically assumed to be met; they are incorporated in the scenario
only to the extent that they are underpinned by adequate provisions for their
implementation. Each year many countries add new policies and some abandon existing
ones. Each annual iteration of the STEPS takes account of these changes. This version is
no exception. The STEPS is associated with a temperature rise of 2.4 °C in 2100 (with a
50% probability).



Announced Pledges Scenario (APS): This scenario starts from the same detailed reading
of government policies but takes a different view on their implementation. The key
difference is that this scenario assumes that all national energy and climate targets,
including longer term net zero emissions targets and pledges in Nationally Determined

3 Energy Technology Perspectives 2024, a forthcoming IEA publication, includes a detailed discussion on the

production and trade of clean energy technologies, along with their main components and material inputs.

78

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Contributions, are met in full and on time. This is a strong assumption, given that most
governments are still far from having policies in place to deliver their long-term pledges.
Even those countries without long-term energy or emissions goals follow a different
path than in the STEPS because their investment choices are shaped by and benefit from
steeper cost reductions for a range of clean energy technologies made possible by the
actions of other countries. The APS is associated with a temperature rise of 1.7 °C in
2100 (with a 50% probability).


Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario: This scenario portrays a pathway for the
global energy sector to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 which is consistent with
limiting long-term global warming to 1.5 °C with limited overshoot (with a 50%
probability). The NZE Scenario also meets the key energy-related UN Sustainable
Development Goals, in particular by achieving universal access to modern energy
services by 2030 and securing major improvements in air quality. Even though the global
rise in temperature is already approaching or even exceeding the 1.5 °C limit in
individual years, this does not mean that the target itself is out of reach. But every year
in which global emissions rise and actions fall short of what is needed for the future
makes this pathway steeper and harder to climb.

The NZE Scenario is a normative scenario in that it works backwards from a defined outcome.
The Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios are exploratory, in that they do not
target a specific outcome but rather establish different sets of starting conditions and
consider where they may lead.
The main scenarios in this Outlook are accompanied by a number of sensitivity cases. These
are built around the STEPS and look at some of the most pertinent and topical dynamics
affecting the energy sector and how these impact future energy demand and emissions levels
(see Chapter 4). The sensitivity cases explored include: the pace at which consumers choose
to purchase electric cars; future deployment of renewables in the power sector;
uncertainties related to natural gas demand in the light of the new LNG supply that is set to
come online; uncertainties about future electricity demand, particularly related to how much
electricity data centres will use; and how far the efficiency of end-use appliances will
improve.

Policies

A crucial part of each annual edition of the World Energy Outlook is an in-depth
country-by-country review of government policies, regulatory measures, targets and
announcements that could affect the way that the energy sector evolves. The modelling and
analysis incorporate measures relating to fuel and power supply, end-use sectors, i.e.
transport, buildings and industry, short- and long-term climate pledges, sustainable
development objectives and energy access goals, and industrial and trade policies related to
the energy sector. The policies that are considered in the STEPS and the APS are highlighted
in Annex B.

Energy and climate policies

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There have been many new energy and climate initiatives since the WEO-2023, including
policy announcements, investment plans and regulations. Some examples of the sorts of
policies that were considered when developing the STEPS for 2024 include:


Argentina passed major free-market reforms designed to stimulate investment in new
oil and gas infrastructure.



Australia adopted its first New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, which will apply to new cars
sold from 2025.



Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Korea all passed legislation designed to advance the
development of new projects for carbon capture, utilisation and storage.



Canada adopted a new Green Buildings Strategy to accelerate retrofits by providing
financial support of close to CAD 1 billion in its 2024 budget.



China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment issued a new Air Quality Improvement
Policy targeting a reduction in the density of particulate emissions and in the number of
severe pollution incidents.



The European Union adopted its first-ever regulation on reducing methane emissions.
The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism started its first transitional phase of
operation, introducing a reporting requirement for importers of cement, iron and steel,
aluminium, fertilisers, electricity and hydrogen.



Indonesia’s Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan was finalised as part of the Just
Energy Transition Partnership.



Korea confirmed its 11th Basic Electricity Supply and Demand Plan, a 15-year blueprint
for electricity supply and demand that includes a significant expansion of nuclear, wind
and solar power.



South Africa released a draft Gas Master Plan for public comment.



A new government in the United Kingdom lifted the de facto ban on new onshore wind
development.



The United States Environmental Protection Agency released new regulations on
greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for fossil fuel-fired power plants, along with
multi-pollutant emissions standards for cars and trucks.



New sanctions on Russian LNG developments and trade were announced by the United
States and the European Union.



The United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adopted Order no. 1920, that
requires transmission providers to conduct long-term planning for regional transmission
facilities and to determine how to pay for them.



Viet Nam adopted an implementation plan for its National Power Development Master
Plan for the 2021 to 2030 period, and also approved a new mechanism to allow
renewable project developers to sell electricity directly to large consumers.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Since the WEO-2023, 38 countries, responsible for one-third of energy-related CO2
emissions, have implemented new government spending measures for clean energy
technologies. Around 35 countries, responsible for 20% of global emissions, have adopted
new or updated energy-related regulations (Figure 2.8). There have also been some rollbacks
and postponements of previous policies, although the impact of these remains relatively
small.

boilers or internal combustion engine cars.

The first global stocktake at COP28 in Dubai in 2023 agreed on a notable set of new policyrelevant considerations for the energy sector. It includes – for the first time – a call to
“accelerate global efforts towards net zero emissions energy systems utilising zero- and lowcarbon fuels well before or by around mid-century” and a call to “transition away from fossil
fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner”. The COP28 outcome also set out some of the
actions in the energy sector needed to achieve these goals, many of which were based on
the NZE Scenario. They include: aims to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030;
double the rate energy efficiency improvement by 2030; accelerate efforts to phase down
unabated coal-fired power; substantially reduce methane emissions; and to phase out as
soon as possible inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that do not address energy poverty or just

Support for energy investment and consumer energy affordability
The IEA tracks government support for energy investment, looking at licensing regimes,
major project approvals and large infrastructure developments as well as direct support and
tax credit provisions. Specific government support for clean energy investment was
incorporated in a number of government recovery plans made in response to the Covid-19
pandemic and the global energy crisis. Announcements of government support for clean
energy investment since 2020 cumulatively reached USD 2 trillion in the first-half of 2024
(Figure 2.9). More than 40% of these announcements were made in 2022, and many
stemmed from the US Inflation Reduction Act and other responses to the energy crisis in that
year.

examines what full implementation of the COP28 goals would mean for energy and emissions, and assesses
the risks and pitfalls of partial implementation (IEA, 2024e).

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Governments also spent heavily on short-term consumer energy affordability during the
global energy crisis – cumulatively around USD 940 billion – with the aim of helping to shield
consumers and industries from very high energy prices. These measures have now mostly
been rolled back.

Industrial policies
Recent years have seen countries place more focus on bolstering domestic manufacturing,
with a particular interest in clean technology sectors (Table 2.1). For example, both the US
Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net Zero Industry Act marked a reorientation of industrial
policies towards incentives for domestic manufacturing. Around 10% of the USD 2 trillion
explicitly earmarked globally for direct clean energy investment support since 2020 comes
with conditions that require local content in one way or another, for example by specifying
minimum levels of local labour, domestically sourced materials and components, or by
requiring the building of specialised factories in the country concerned (Figure 2.10). New
project announcements for manufacturing capacity are taken into account when considering
technology choices in all the WEO scenarios.

land. Firms in countries with a large number of major state-owned enterprises sometimes
receive disproportionately more support overall than firms based in other jurisdictions. For
example, grants and below-market borrowing account for an estimated 3% of the revenues
of firms based in China, compared with less than 0.1% in advanced economies (OECD, 2024).

Policy uncertainty
The STEPS is not a normative scenario: it does not assume an inevitable shift over time
towards stronger action on emissions reductions. It simply maps out the implications of the
prevailing policy settings, whatever they might be. Policy settings can and do change from
year to year, and any such policy changes are incorporated into successive editions of the
STEPS.
Some changes roll back commitments to emissions reductions or clean energy deployment.
This applies both to sustainability targets and the enabling measures that are designed to
reach them. In some cases, these changes happen because ambitions were set at a level that
now appears to be unrealistic. In 2019, for example, the administration in Scotland
committed itself to a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 from their
1990 level. This target is now set to be dropped. At corporate level, there are many examples
of firms adjusting their near-term targets, usually making them less stringent, in response to
unfavourable market conditions, doubts surrounding government policy, or a realisation that
achieving targets would be more difficult than initially assumed. In other cases, decision
makers have argued that too much emphasis was being placed on energy transition
measures at the expense of other goals, including those related to energy security and
affordability, and changes in response to this sometimes mean longer timelines for
introducing new technologies, or reduced incentives and policy support for their
deployment.
The effects of such changes will vary by country and technology: supportive policies are
important, but they are not the only driver of change (Spotlight). In a year of elections around
the world, there is even more uncertainty than usual over the future evolution of energy and
climate policies. In all cases, we will continue to track policies and their implementation very
closely in the WEO and provide a neutral and dispassionate assessment of what they mean
for the future of energy, as well as their implications for energy security, affordability and
emissions.

S P O T L I G H T
How much do public policies matter for energy transitions?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Clean energy deployment has picked up strongly in recent years. Our latest estimate of
energy investment flows suggests that clean energy projects are likely to attract almost
twice as much capital in 2024 as fossil fuel projects. How much are these deployment and
investment trends dependent on supportive energy policies?
Public policies typically play a key role in enabling and de-risking the early adoption of
new technologies, including clean energy technologies. This was the case for solar PV,
wind and EVs. Policies can also help markets price negative externalities, improve
working conditions, promote standardisation, facilitate research and development, and
knowledge access.
Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

85

Many emerging clean energy technologies still require policy support to compete with
traditional technologies, but some are now mature, and their deployment is increasingly
driven by economic fundamentals. For example, it is now cheaper to build onshore wind
and solar power projects than new fossil fuel plants almost everywhere around the
world, and the economic arguments remain strong even when considering the
accompanying investment required to cope with their variability of generation (IEA,
2023a).
The same is true for a number of end-use energy technologies, especially when
comparing the total cost of ownership over the lifetimes with competing traditional
technologies. 5 In many countries, electric cars and two/three-wheelers cost less over
their lifetime than equivalent vehicles with internal combustion engines because lower
re-fuelling and maintenance costs outweigh higher initial upfront costs (Figure 2.11).
Efficient appliances, such as high efficiency air conditioning units, generally pay back any
upfront premium through lower operating costs. Heat pumps can be more expensive
than gas-fired boilers for heating alone, though this depends on the relative price of
electricity and gas, but they are typically competitive when considering both cooling and
heating (IEA, 2024b).

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Renewables deployment is driven in many cases by energy security considerations. This
is especially the case where consumers have been exposed to supply shortfalls and high
prices for fossil fuels during the global energy crisis. It is also driven by long-term strategic
considerations, with countries and companies in some cases vying for position in clean
energy sectors that are likely to be major sources of employment and revenue growth in
future years.
Policies will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping the way that energy transitions
unfold. Without government support, many new and emerging technologies are likely to
struggle to gain momentum, and many lower income countries, communities and
households will find it difficult to afford the upfront costs of clean energy technologies,
causing them to miss out on the life cycle benefits. Transparent and robust policies and
regulations are also crucial to provide the confidence that private sector actors need to
finance and invest in clean energy transitions. Even though they are not the only drivers
of change, policy changes will therefore affect the pace of energy transitions to a greater
or lesser degree – accelerating them in some cases, slowing them in others.

2.2.2

GDP and population

The global economy is assumed to grow on average by 2.7% each year to 2050 in all three
scenarios (Table 2.2). This growth rate varies by country, region and over time, influenced by
factors such as investment dynamics, employment rates and shifts in trade. We recognise
that the speed, structure, and selection of policy and regulatory mechanisms driving changes
in the energy system will have broader economic effects, both positive and negative, across
various countries and regions. However, we maintain a constant economic growth rate
across scenarios to facilitate a comparison of the impacts of different energy and climate
choices with a consistent backdrop.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The global population is assumed to expand from 8 billion people in 2023 to 9.7 billion in
2050, based on the median population projection of the United Nations. This represents an
annual average growth rate of around 0.7%, which is around half the average annual growth
rate seen between 1990 and 2023. Fertility rates have fallen in many parts of the world, and
projections of the world’s population in 2100 are now 700 million lower than they were ten
years ago (Box 2.1). Population increases to 2050 in countries in sub-Saharan Africa account
for more than half of the overall increase at the world level, and increases in India, Pakistan
and Bangladesh for a further 20%. Urban populations bulge in all regions, while rural
populations decline in all regions other than Africa (Figure 2.12). 6

6 The physical impacts of climate change are not incorporated into our projections of population and GDP, but

these could lead to large changes in global and regional economic growth and in migration patterns, with
important implications for energy demand.

Declining fertility rates are tempering expectations
for future population growth

A large number of countries currently have a fertility rate below 2.1, which is the average
level needed to sustain long-term replacement of the population (Figure 2.13). The global
average total fertility rate has fallen by around 10% over the past ten years and is now
around 2.3. Several factors contribute, including broader female education and career
opportunities, high housing and living costs, and a delay in the age of starting families.
Declines have been most marked in the Asia Pacific region, with India, China, Pakistan
and Bangladesh all having fertility rates about one-third lower than 20 years ago.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The decrease has become even more pronounced in the past five years, with China’s
fertility rate falling by 35%, and India, Japan, Kenya, Egypt and many European countries
seeing a drop of around 10%. These trends are expected to continue in the years ahead
and are a key determinant of slowing growth in the global population. Future declines in
the fertility rate are forecast to be steepest in countries in sub-Saharan Africa: by 2050,
the total fertility rate of sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be around 2.8, similar to the
level in Egypt today.

Natural gas (USD/MBtu)

Steam coal (USD/tonne)

Notes: MBtu = million British thermal units. The IEA crude oil price is a weighted average of import prices
among IEA member countries. Natural gas prices are weighted averages expressed on a gross calorific-value
basis. The US natural gas price reflects the wholesale price prevailing on the domestic market. Natural gas
prices in the European Union and China reflect a balance of pipeline and LNG imports, while the Japan gas
price is solely for LNG imports. LNG prices are those at the customs border, prior to regasification. Steam coal
prices are weighted averages adjusted to 6 000 kilocalories per kilogramme. The US steam coal price reflects
mine mouth prices plus transport and handling costs. Coastal China steam coal price reflects a balance of
imports and domestic sales, while the European Union and Japanese steam coal prices are solely for imports.
Wholesale prices exclude any emissions pricing applied at the point of use.

Oil

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Oil prices in our scenarios act as intermediaries to balance global supply and demand,
ensuring markets remain in equilibrium. They are assumed to follow smooth trajectories in
all scenarios despite the ever-present risk of volatility. The STEPS sees near-term downward
pressure on prices, which remain below 2023 levels all the way through to 2050; as noted,
much depends on the investment and market management strategies followed by major
producers (Table 2.3). In the APS, stringent policy measures lead to a stronger decline in
demand and the oil price falls to USD 58/barrel in 2050. In the NZE Scenario, there is a sharp
decline in the oil price to 2030 as a marked decrease in demand means that the price is set
by the operating costs of the marginal producer, and by 2050 prices fall to around
USD 25/barrel. In the APS and NZE scenarios, policies are sufficiently strong to counteract
any effect of lower prices on demand that could jeopardise climate goals (IEA, 2024f).
The production plans and resilience of major resource-holders strongly influence prices in
our scenarios. In the STEPS and APS, continued market management by major producers is
assumed to keep prices at higher levels than implied by the global supply cost curve. In the
90

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

NZE Scenario, producer economies may struggle to manage strains placed on their fiscal
balances from reductions in oil and gas income, and this could lead to higher and more
volatile prices.

Natural gas
Natural gas markets gradually rebalanced in 2023 as a result of timely policy actions in
response to the global energy crisis, increased global LNG exports, and favourable weather
conditions. In the STEPS, the US natural gas price rises to 2030 to ensure a smooth balance
between domestic supply, demand and exports. In parallel, global gas trade continues to
pivot toward LNG, and portfolio players act as important intermediaries between supply and
demand. The large number of new LNG liquefaction facilities coming online over the period
to 2030 leads to supply capacity in excess of global LNG demand. Prices in 2030 in Europe,
Japan and China fall to levels substantially lower than those seen in 2023, as rapid growth in
renewables and electrification limits the potential for a robust demand response to ample
LNG supply. For LNG projects under construction, average delivered costs are estimated to
be around USD 8 per million British thermal units (MBtu), and so some LNG investors may
struggle to recoup their invested capital within an acceptable timeframe. Natural gas prices
gradually increase around the world after 2030 as the overhang in LNG is worked off. In the
APS and the NZE Scenario, demand and prices are much lower around the world.

Coal
Global coal consumption reached a record high in 2023, but coal prices fell from the
unprecedented highs reached in many regions in 2022. Prices further decline through to 2050
in all three scenarios. In the STEPS, there is a need to maintain existing mines and open some
new mines as demand falls steadily, but prices still fall by around 30-50% to 2030 in importing
regions. In the APS, a faster decline in demand allows for the closure of some high-cost mines,
leading to a deeper fall in prices. In the NZE Scenario, only the lowest cost mines are needed,
and prices drop to very low levels. Higher-than-expected growth in coal consumption in
China or India, as well as unfavourable conditions for renewable energy production, e.g. low
precipitation, light winds, could pose upside risks to coal prices. Conversely, the development
of new coal mines could weigh on prices if coal-fired power plants face tougher competition
from solar power.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Critical mineral prices
We do not yet model full long-term supply-demand balances for critical minerals in the same
way as for fuels, but we do undertake market monitoring and scenario benchmarking. The
prices of many critical minerals – particularly for batteries – fell in 2023 after two years of
dramatic increases. Lithium spot prices fell by 75% and other key materials such as nickel,
cobalt, manganese and graphite saw price drops of 30-45%. However, copper prices
remained at elevated levels, and with the exception of cobalt and graphite, the prices of most
critical minerals are higher than the average levels seen in the 2010s.

Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

91

2

The drop in critical mineral prices stemmed mainly from a rapid ramp-up in supply in 2023.
A number of new projects came online relatively quickly, adding sizeable volumes to the
supply pool, and the ramp-up of new supply has outpaced demand growth over the past two
years. An inventory overhang in the downstream battery sector also played a role. Price
declines helped reduce the cost of clean technologies, but also caused financial difficulties
for some existing and planned supply projects.

Carbon prices
Today, just under one-quarter of global GHG emissions are covered by a carbon price of some
type through carbon taxes and/or emissions trading systems. Aggregate revenues from
carbon pricing initiatives rose to more than USD 100 billion in 2023, a record high. Half of
these revenues were generated by the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).
The STEPS incorporates existing and scheduled carbon pricing initiatives, with market-based
initiatives rising continuously and carbon taxes and other non-market mechanisms remaining
constant unless scheduled to increase. It sees the EU ETS CO2 price for power generation rise
to just under USD 160/tonne CO2 in 2050. In the APS, net zero emissions pledges lead to
higher CO2 prices across all regions, with prices rising by 2050 to USD 200/tonne CO2 on
average in advanced economies, and to USD 160/tonne CO2 in China, India and Indonesia. In
the NZE Scenario, carbon prices are introduced in all regions and cover most sectors: they
rise to USD 250/tonne CO2 in 2050 in advanced economies and USD 200/tonne CO2 in major
economies including China, Brazil, India and South Africa, with lower price levels elsewhere
(see Annex B).
As with other policy measures, carbon prices are assumed to be introduced with careful
consideration of the consequences for tax burdens and the potential for negative
distributional impacts. The level of carbon prices included in our scenarios should be
interpreted with caution: the scenarios include several other energy policies and
accompanying measures designed to reduce CO2 emissions, and this means that the carbon
prices shown do not necessarily reflect the marginal costs of abatement.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Wholesale and retail prices
There is a large difference between wholesale prices for fuels and the retail prices paid by
consumers. Retail prices reflect the cost of producing fuels that end-users need and the cost
of delivering them: they commonly include the costs of transport, refining, marketing and
distribution, as well as customs duties, excise taxes, value-added taxes and subsidies, all of
which vary between, and sometimes within, countries. Retail prices are generally higher than
wholesale prices, and sometimes much higher. For example, the average retail price of
gasoline in Europe is around two-and-a-half times the wholesale price of oil, with taxes
accounting for around half of the retail price paid by consumers. Conversely, in the Middle
East, subsidies mean the retail price for gasoline is on average lower than the wholesale price

92

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

(Figure 2.14). 7 Assumptions about the phase-out of fossil fuel consumption subsidies vary by
scenario: in the STEPS, for example, they are only removed if there is a specific commitment
to do so.
Retail prices and wholesale prices do not always move in tandem. For example, the average
wholesale natural gas price in Europe fell by two-thirds in 2023, while the average retail price
increased by 14% as measures introduced by governments to keep retail prices from rising
significantly during the global energy crisis came to an end in many countries. Retail
electricity prices tend to be less volatile than other retail fuel prices because around half of
electricity demand globally is in markets with regulated prices based on average costs.

Technology costs

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Supply chain pressures and higher critical minerals prices pushed up the cost of a number of
key clean energy technologies in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 2.15). These pressures eased in 2023,
and costs in most cases started to fall back. The IEA Clean Energy Equipment Price Index
tracks price movements in a global basket of solar PV modules, wind turbines and lithium-ion
batteries for EVs and battery storage, weighted by shares of investment. Costs for most clean

subsidies (IEA, 2023b).

energy technologies have resumed a downward path and the fourth-quarter of 2023 saw the
index falling to its lowest ever level.
The drop in critical mineral prices in 2023 led to a 10% reduction in that industry’s revenue
and a 34% fall in operating profits. Lower prices may stimulate an acceleration in clean
energy technology deployment in the medium term, but they could lead to longer term risks
if they constrain investment and the critical mineral industry's ability to develop new supply
projects. Given the importance of critical minerals to the cost of clean energy technologies
and expected demand growth in the use of clean technologies, reduced investment could
lead to future supply shortages and price spikes. This could slow reductions in clean energy
technology costs, or even increase them, as happened in 2022 with battery pack prices,
potentially hindering clean energy technology deployment.

In the IEA Global Energy and Climate Model, the future evolution of technology costs
depends on continued research, improvements in manufacturing and learning-by-doing.
These costs are linked to levels of deployment and vary by scenario. They do not follow a
linear path. A typical curve has the steepest rate of cost reduction in the earliest phases of
innovation and deployment, when overall costs are still high: costs then fall more slowly as
technologies mature. Policies play a crucial role in this process, particularly in determining
94

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

how quickly new clean technologies are scaled up in sectors such as shipping, aviation and
heavy industry.
The recent evolution of upstream oil and gas costs also shows short-term fluctuations. The
IEA Upstream Oil and Gas Capital Cost Index, which tracks how the capital costs of a set of
representative upstream oil and gas projects around the world evolve over time, rose by
close to 7% in 2022 as a result of higher raw material prices and constrained markets for
services and labour. Costs fell slightly in 2023 as inflation eased, but the drop was smaller
than seen in batteries and solar PV. Upstream costs in 2023, however, were still nearly 15%
below 2014 levels following extensive efforts by operators in recent years to downsize and
simplify project designs to maintain competitiveness.
Solar PV module prices fell by 30% in 2023. A recent surge in solar production capacity in
China is decreasing margins for solar PV manufacturers setting the stage for a possible
market consolidation among manufacturers in the near term. Chinese exports of solar cells
and modules reached 255 GW in 2023, triple the 2019 level.

Battery pack prices dropped by 14% in 2023 to a record low of USD 139 per kilowatt-hour
(kWh) following reductions in battery critical mineral prices and a surge in battery cell
production capacity (Figure 2.16). Since 2013, battery pack costs have fallen almost sixfold
Chapter 2 | Setting the scene

due to economies of scale and manufacturing optimisation. However, the proportion of costs
accounted for by the cost of cathode raw materials in the battery pack price has been rising.
Around 30% of the cost of a battery pack now depends on the cost of critical minerals, and
battery costs are increasingly susceptible to mineral price volatility. Material substitution can
mitigate price volatility to an extent, as it did when lithium iron phosphate battery chemistry
displaced nickel-rich battery chemistries during the recent years of high nickel and cobalt
prices. However, there is no alternative at present for some of the critical minerals used for
particular functions in battery packs, including copper in the current collector in lithium-ion
battery anodes and graphite in lithium-ion batteries.
Manufacturing costs for wind turbines rose in second-quarter 2023 as a result of an increase
in steel and freight costs. Companies in China have so far proven able to produce wind
turbines at lower cost than their European counterparts. However, this has not translated
into a large increase in exports due in large part to the costs and logistical complexities of
moving large wind turbines very long distances.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Offshore wind has higher upfront costs than onshore wind and solar PV. In 2023, developers
struggled with project profitability due to inflation, high interest rates and supply chain
challenges in connection with large turbine manufacturing and installation. Several contracts
were cancelled because previously agreed prices became unviable. As ever, governments will
need to pay close attention to market and cost dynamics as they design policies and support
schemes for emerging technologies.

Pathways for the energy mix
Peaks coming into view?
S U M M A R Y
• Global energy markets found a tentative new balance in 2023, with natural gas prices
coming down after skyrocketing in 2022 in Europe and other parts of the world, and
with an increase of 2.1% in global energy demand, in line with the average rate in the
two decades before 2020.

• While a growing global population and higher incomes increase the need for energy
services, energy demand growth slows to 0.7% per year from 2023 to 2030 in the
Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), half the rate of the past decade. Most growth occurs
in emerging market and developing economies. Efficiency gains and electrification
lead to a slight decline in global energy demand in the Announced Pledges Scenario
(APS), and to a more significant fall in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.

• Strong electricity demand growth is a feature of all three scenarios, driven not just by
economic growth but also by increasing electrification of end-uses, notably electric
vehicles, and by rising demand for data centres. The share of electricity in final
consumption increases from 20% today to 26% in 2035 in the STEPS, 29% in the APS
and 36% in the NZE Scenario. Electricity demand in China rises particularly fast and is
set to surpass the level of demand in all advanced economies combined by 2030.

• Low-emissions sources, led by renewables, increase faster than electricity demand in
all scenarios, thereby pushing down the share of fossil fuels in electricity generation.
In 2023, renewables provided 30% of global electricity supply, while fossil fuels edged
down to 60%, their lowest share in 50 years. By 2035, the share of solar PV and wind
in electricity generation exceeds 40% globally in the STEPS, and by 2050 increases to
nearly 60%. The share of nuclear power remains close to 10% in all scenarios.

• Fossil fuels met 80% of global energy demand in 2023. As in the WEO-2023, our
scenarios indicate that demand for oil, natural gas and coal is set to peak by 2030,
though oil use for aviation and petrochemicals increases to 2050 in the STEPS, natural
gas demand remains robust in emerging market and developing economies, and the
decline in coal use is relatively gradual. Higher clean energy investment and a faster
descent from these peaks is needed to fulfil announced pledges and move the world
towards a net zero emissions pathway.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Seven clean energy technologies – solar PV, wind, nuclear, electric vehicles, heat
pumps, hydrogen and carbon capture – are key to affordable and secure transitions.
Together they account for three-quarters of the CO2 emissions reductions to 2050 in
the APS and the NZE Scenario, complemented by other renewables such as bioenergy
and geothermal, and energy efficiency. Overcoming barriers to their deployment,
including network and storage infrastructure, should be a priority worldwide.

Introduction

Tensions in global energy markets calmed to a degree in 2023, and global energy demand
rebounded by 2.1%, which means that the rate of growth was above its average rate from
2000 to 2019. Population growth and rising incomes continued to spur higher consumer
demand for energy services, and patterns of demand continued to evolve, with data centres
and artificial intelligence requiring increasing amounts of energy, for example.
This is the starting point for our modelling process in this World Energy Outlook (WEO-2024).
The first step in producing our scenario projections is not to look at emissions, investment or
resources, but to look in detail at demand for energy services. In other words, we look first
at how much light, heat, mobility and information services communities, industries and
countries around the world are likely to need over the decades to 2050. Government policies
lay the foundation, and over 5 000 policies in countries around the world have been
collected, documented and analysed by technology and sector.
Levels of energy services demand increase at broadly the same rate in each of our scenarios
as the global economy grows, with two important exceptions. The first concerns progress
towards universal access to modern energy: this varies by scenario, which affects the level
of demand for energy services because progress towards achievement of this goal invariably
leads to higher use of energy services in many countries for lighting, cooling, and appliance
and equipment use. The second concerns the adoption of behavioural changes and mode
shifts: these too vary by scenario, and the differences affect the level of energy service
demand, for example when substituting public transport, walking or cycling for short car
journeys or increasing the recycling of plastics.

Rising energy services demand is common in each scenario, but how this translates into
overall energy and emissions trends is subject to the technologies deployed and innovation
unlocked in each outlook. A range of technology mixes can meet needs for heating, cooling
or mobility, each with distinctive implications for cost, resource use and pollution. We
explore various pathways in this chapter, examining how decisions to invest in different
technologies and resources could meet the world’s future energy needs and how policies
shape the choices ahead. We have four focus areas.


First, we examine trends in global final energy consumption in the industry, transport
and buildings sectors, and how that demand is met in each scenario.



Second, we examine the outlook for electricity, including the drivers of electricity
demand growth, the evolving electricity supply mix, emissions and investment.



Third, we consider oil, natural gas, coal and bioenergy, and the ways in which they will
be shaped by the speed at which clean energy technologies are deployed.



Fourth, we probe the role of and outlook for specific key clean energy technologies that
include solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power, nuclear power, electric vehicles (EVs),
heat pumps, hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS).

Overview

Today, global energy demand stands at around 640 exajoules (EJ). By 2035, it rises to 680 EJ
in the STEPS, falls slightly to around 625 EJ in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and
declines to 540 EJ in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario – three distinct trends
based on the same economic and population growth assumptions. In the STEPS, the only
scenario which sees continued growth in global energy demand, the rate from now to 2035
is only around one-third as high as it was over the past decade, and all the growth in energy
demand comes from emerging market and developing economies.

As first presented in the World Energy Outlook 2023 (WEO-2023), in each scenario, demand
for each fossil fuel peaks by 2030 (Figure 3.1). In the STEPS, coal demand begins to decline
around 2025, while oil and natural gas demand both peak towards the end of the decade.
After decades of the fossil fuel share of total energy supply hovering around 80%, it declines
to 75% by 2030 and below 60% by 2050. In the APS, each fossil fuel reaches its peak by 2025
and the overall fossil fuel share declines to around 35% in 2050. The NZE Scenario involves a
more complete transition with all fossil fuels declining from today to make up less than 65%
of total energy supply by 2030 and around 15% by 2050.

How does the Stated Policies Scenario 2024 differ from the
2023 version?

Each scenario is modified annually to incorporate adjustments to historical data as
countries gain a better understanding of what has already happened in terms of energy
supply and demand. In this year’s scenarios for example, updated data in China, India and
Southeast Asia in particular mean that global coal demand starts at a baseline about 3.5%
above the value in WEO-2023.
The trajectories of the WEO scenarios are also updated each year to reflect the latest
changes in policies and the most recent market and investment data. Changes since the
WEO-2023 have had a material impact on the outlook for coal, natural gas and electricity.
In the STEPS, the outlook for coal has been revised upwards particularly for the coming
decade, principally as a result of updated electricity demand projections, notably from
China and India. Total coal demand is 300 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) or 6%
higher in 2030 than in the WEO-2023. Even with this revision, coal demand declines by
an average of 2% each year through to 2050.
The outlook for total natural gas demand in the STEPS is also higher in 2024. This is mostly
the result of stronger projected electricity demand growth, particularly in China, and an
increase in natural gas supply reflecting expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity.
By 2035, total natural gas demand is around 175 billion cubic metres (bcm) or 4% higher
in this year's STEPS than in 2023. As in the WEO-2023, however, total natural gas demand
flattens by the end of this decade.
Higher electricity demand in the STEPS 2024 mainly reflects projected increased light
industry activity, notably in China, much of it associated with a rapid rise in clean
technology manufacturing. Upward revisions also reflect faster adoption of EVs,
increased demand from data centres, and increased electrification of industrial processes
in emerging market and developing economies. By 2035, electricity demand is over
2 000 terawatt-hours (TWh) or 6% higher in this edition than in the WEO-2023.

Energy efficiency

Global energy intensity reduced by 1% in 2023, a smaller improvement than the 2% reduction
seen in 2022. Certain emerging market and developing economies made relatively slow
progress, while there were significant energy intensity improvements elsewhere, including
in the United States and European Union, largely driven by mild weather, high energy prices
and reduced industrial activity. Annual investment in energy efficiency exceeded
USD 390 billion in 2023, up from USD 300 billion in 2020. Many major economies have
adopted legislative and policy measures that are set to deliver further efficiency gains over
the coming years, including: the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States; the Energy
Efficiency Directive in the European Union; the revised Act on Rationalizing Energy Use in
Japan; and the most recent cycle of the Perform, Achieve and Trade scheme in India.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

Annual intensity improvements worldwide from today to 2030 average 2.3% in the STEPS
and 3% in the APS. Only in the NZE Scenario do annual improvements exceed 4%, to achieve
a doubling from the 2022 baseline of 2% by 2030 in line with the pledges made by nearly
200 countries at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) (Figure 3.2). The benefits of
doubling efficiency improvements include reducing energy bills; alleviating fuel poverty;
creating almost 5 million jobs globally; contributing half of emissions reductions needed in
the NZE Scenario by 2030; and helping to create healthier living environments. In each
scenario, intensity improvements occur at a similar pace in both groupings – advanced
economies and emerging market and developing economies – with advanced economies
remaining on average about 35% less energy intensive than emerging market and developing
economies through to 2030.

Technical efficiency improvements such as building retrofits and vehicle fuel economy
advances contribute the largest share of energy savings by 2030 in each scenario. Switching
from direct combustion of fossil fuels to renewables, electricity and other more efficient
energy sources contributes the second-largest share. Behavioural changes as well as
infrastructure- or technology-enabled changes such as mode shifting and enhanced recycling
also contribute. Providing clean cooking in lieu of highly inefficient and polluting traditional
cooking methods is a particularly important source of energy savings in sub-Saharan Africa
and other emerging market and developing economies.

Renewables

Total supply of modern renewables 1 increased by 5% year-on-year to nearly 78 EJ in 2023,
providing 12% of total energy supply. Global investment in renewables increased by 20% in
2023 to nearly USD 750 billion, equivalent to nearly 1% of global gross domestic product
(GDP) (IEA, 2024a). In 2023, global manufacturing capacity increased by 76% for solar PV
modules and 22% for wind nacelle assembly (IEA, 2024b). Global renewable capacity
additions totalled over 560 gigawatts (GW) in 2023 – a 60% increase from the previous year,
led by a boom in solar PV, particularly in China – and they are set to exceed 670 GW in 2024.

NZE Scenario (Figure 3.3). Despite the gains made in the STEPS and APS, these scenarios do
not meet the COP28 pledge to triple renewables capacity by 2030, which is consistent with
the NZE Scenario. From today to 2030, renewables make up at least four-fifths of total
capacity additions in each scenario, heavily outweighing additions of unabated fossil fuel
capacity, with solar PV and wind power dominating new capacity in all major markets. The
share of electricity generation from renewables increases from 30% today to 45% in the

heat generation and direct final consumption.

STEPS by 2030, 50% in the APS and nearly 60% in the NZE Scenario, reducing cumulative
emissions in 2030 from today’s level by around 1.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2),
3 Gt CO2 and 4.5 Gt CO2 respectively.
While most modern renewables are used in the power sector, 24 EJ of modern renewables
were consumed directly in end-use applications in 2023, largely in the form of modern
bioenergy, solar thermal and geothermal energy. These direct uses rise modestly in the
STEPS, but they gain ground more rapidly in the APS and NZE Scenario in large part due to
increased use of biofuels in transport, which provide an important decarbonisation pathway
in sectors such as shipping and aviation where electrification is a less cost-competitive
solution. The use of modern bioenergy in residential buildings also increases in tandem with
faster progress to provide universal access to clean cooking.

S P O T L I G H T
When will energy-related CO2 emissions peak?
Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reached a record high in 2023, with the vast
majority stemming from the energy sector. Following a rise of 1% in 2022, global energyrelated CO2 emissions rose 1.3% in 2023 (Figure 3.4). Coal use was the single largest
contributor to CO2 emissions, accounting for 15.7 gigatonnes (Gt) of the 37.7 Gt CO2
released by the energy sector in 2023, followed by oil (11.3 Gt CO2) and natural gas
(7.5 Gt CO2). Coal also accounted for almost 80% of the increase in CO2 emissions in 2023.
However, fossil fuel demand is projected to peak in all scenarios by 2030, which means
that a turning point in emissions should be near. Rapidly increasing deployment of clean
energy technologies, in particular solar and wind, has already begun to dampen the
upward trajectory of CO2 emissions, and to bring about a structural slowdown in energyrelated CO2 emissions.
Over 3 900 Mtce of coal was consumed in the power sector – by far the main source of
coal demand – and this emitted 11.3 Gt CO2 in 2023. Emerging market and developing
economies accounted for 84% of coal use in the power sector in 2023, of which China
alone was around 55% of the global total. Yet, rapid expansion of solar PV and wind in
many power systems is already making inroads into coal use for power generation.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Coal faces less competition in the industry sector, where demand remains stable in the
STEPS to 2030. Around 1 200 Mtce – roughly three-quarters of total industrial coal
demand – are consumed in the production of iron, steel and cement, mostly for use in
building new infrastructure. However, the substitution of coal by other sources of energy,
such as electricity, bioenergy or natural gas, does augment in the latter years of this
decade, prompting downward trends in coal demand in industry and CO2 emissions.

3.3

Total final consumption

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Total final energy consumption across end-use sectors increased by 1.7% to 445 EJ in 2023,
split between the industry sector (more than 170 EJ), buildings (about 125 EJ), transport
(around 120 EJ), and agriculture and other non-energy uses (around 25 EJ) (Figure 3.5).
Consumption continues to climb steadily for the rest of the decade in the STEPS, increasing
at an average annual rate of 1.3% to 2030, in line with the rate seen over the last ten years:
then the pace slows, with the annual growth rate between 2030 to 2050 falling to an average
of only 0.5%. In the APS, efficiency gains and higher electrification rates curb energy
consumption growth: despite economic growth and improved energy access, it rises only
modestly to 2030 and then falls slightly between 2030 and 2050. In the NZE Scenario, even
faster electrification and energy efficiency improvements mean that energy consumption
declines by 2030 and falls significantly further by 2050.
By 2035, total final consumption increases by nearly 55 EJ in the STEPS, bringing it to almost
500 EJ. This increase takes place solely in emerging market and developing economies. In
advanced economies, most increased consumption this decade comes from the industry
sector, but this is offset by declines in other sectors, notably transport, where rising mobility
needs are more than cancelled out by the use of more efficient energy carriers such as
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

105

electricity; these trends lead to further declines after 2030. In emerging market and
developing economies, industry is the leading growth sector, contributing nearly 20 EJ of
additional demand by 2030, but buildings and transport play increasingly important roles in
the longer term as ownership levels of appliances and vehicles rise. Car ownership is
currently five-times higher in advanced economies than in emerging market and developing
economies: this ratio falls to four-times by 2035 and just over three-times by 2050 as the
global car fleet expands to 1.6 billion vehicles in 2035 and 1.9 billion in 2050.

Note: EJ = exajoules; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050
Scenario.

Direct energy use in end-use sectors accounted for around 55% of total energy-related CO2
emissions of 37.7 Gt CO2 in 2023. Current annual emissions in industry are close to 10 Gt CO2,
in transport over 8 Gt CO2 and in the buildings sector less than 3 Gt CO2 (Figure 3.6). Across
all scenarios, industry consistently accounts for 40% or more of total end-use sector
emissions. In the STEPS, CO2 emissions from end-use sectors stabilise by 2030 due to the
increasing use of low-emissions fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels,
and electricity: the transport sector, which currently has the highest emissions intensity, sees
the biggest absolute declines. In the APS, CO2 emissions start to decline from the mid-2020s
and fall much further by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, emissions from end-use sectors fall more
rapidly to around 1 Gt CO2 in 2050: much of these remaining emissions come from transport,
reflecting the difficulty of decarbonising end-uses like air travel.

The share of fossil fuels in final consumption in the STEPS declines from nearly 66% today to
64% in 2030, and then falls further to 55% in 2050 (Figure 3.7). In the APS, the decline is
steeper, with the share of fossil fuels falling to slightly over 60% in 2030 and little over 35%
by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, the fossil fuel share drops to just over 55% in 2030 and less
than 20% in 2050. By contrast, the use of low-emissions fuels and electricity rises, with their
share of final consumption overtaking that of fossil fuels by the early 2040s in the APS, and
more than five years earlier in the NZE Scenario. The move away from fossil fuels is mainly
driven by electrification of end-uses, in parallel with increasing decarbonisation of power
generation, with the share of electricity in total consumption rising from 20% in 2023 to over
30% in 2050 in the STEPS, over 40% in the APS and nearly 55% in the NZE Scenario. Bioenergy,
hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels also play key roles in the long term, especially in hardto-abate sectors where electrification faces challenges.
Improved energy efficiency and rising rates of electrification are key factors in reducing the
share of fossil fuels in final consumption, but their impact differs by sector. Energy use in
2030 varies the most across scenarios in the buildings sector, with a rise of around 8 EJ from
2023 in the STEPS contrasted with a 4 EJ drop in the APS and a 22 EJ drop in the NZE Scenario.
These variations are largely driven by more rapid gains in access to modern, efficient energy
largely for cooking in developing economies in the APS and particularly in the NZE Scenario,
and by varied speeds in the rollout of mature low-emissions technologies in other end-uses.
Industry sees the smallest variations, with light industry increasing mainly through the
electrification of low- and medium- temperature heat. In the transport sector, variations in

the pace of electrification of road vehicles and fuel economy improvements slow the rate of
demand growth by 2030 in the APS and stimulate a sharp fall in the NZE Scenario, even as

Notes: Renewables refers to the direct use of renewable energy sources. Hydrogen includes hydrogen-based
fuels, such as ammonia and synthetic fuels. Low-emissions electricity includes output from renewable energy
technologies, nuclear and fossil fuel-fired power plants fitted with CCUS, hydrogen and ammonia. Other fuels
includes traditional use of biomass, district heat, non-renewable waste and fossil fuel methanol.

After 2030, electrification becomes the critical driver of shifting energy consumption
patterns, but the uptake of electricity varies by end-use within each sector. In the buildings
sector, progress in space and water heating is relatively slow, with electricity providing only
a 20% share of the total in 2035 in the STEPS (Figure 3.8). For other end-uses in buildings,
electrification reaches around 65% by 2030 in the STEPS. Most of the increase comes from
cooking as traditional use of biomass declines, especially in the NZE Scenario. Light industry
sees faster electrification than heavy industry, which remains reliant on fossil fuels for hightemperature processes, with the result that the electricity share of total consumption in
heavy industry remains below 15% until 2050 in the STEPS. Today, transport has by far the
lowest share of electrification, but the uptake of electric cars and electric two/threewheelers is well underway and on track to rise with current policy settings. The market share
of electric medium- and heavy-freight trucks is also projected to increase, albeit more slowly,
reaching around 12% in 2030 in the STEPS. By contrast, relatively little progress is made in
non-road transport sub-sectors such as aviation and shipping, where the potential for
electrification is restricted by technical and cost limitations.

Note: The analysis shown does not cover the full scope of the industry or transport sectors.

3.3.1

Transport

In 2023, energy demand in the transport sector increased by close to 4%, which is similar to
the rate seen in 2022. Much of this stemmed from increased aviation activity, which
rebounded to over 90% of pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Road transport also contributed
significantly to the increase, up about 2%, reflecting an expansion of the passenger car fleet
by over 20 million vehicles, mostly in China, India and Southeast Asia, reflecting rising
incomes and population growth.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

By the end of this decade, energy demand in the transport sector increases by nearly 10% in
the STEPS (Figure 3.9). Road transport is the primary contributor, followed by aviation. Even
though the car fleet expands by over 10%, energy use in road transport rises around 5%,
reflecting energy efficiency gains and the uptake of EVs. In 2023, 12% of all new cars sold
worldwide were battery electric, almost 10% were internal combustion engine hybrids, and
almost 6% were plug-in hybrids. EV market share, including battery electric and plug-in
hybrids, is expected to exceed 20% in 2024, with around 5% of passenger cars on the road
being electric. By 2030, more than 15% of the global car fleet is electric, as is nearly one-intwo new cars sold in the STEPS.
Electrification in road transport extends beyond passenger cars. For example, zero emissions
heavy-duty trucks accounted for a 10% share of sales in China in December 2023 (BNEF,
2024), and electric buses for a 16% share of sales in the European Union in the first-half of
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

109

2024 (ACEA, 2024). Globally, the bus fleet is set to be over 10% electrified by 2030, and the
heavy-duty trucks fleet to be 3% electric. By 2035, 30% of vehicles on the road are electric in
the STEPS, increasing to 35% in the APS. In the NZE Scenario, nearly 50% of the stock are EVs,
cutting emissions from road transport in half and energy demand by a third relative to
current levels.

In 2024, some automakers in the United States appeared more cautious about investment in
EV manufacturing plants, as customer demand fell short of industry expectations. However,
despite challenges in meeting short-term targets, automakers still aim for more than
40 million EV sales in 2030, which is reflected in the STEPS. Affordability and charging
infrastructure need to be addressed to overcome potential bottlenecks. Declining battery
prices should enable automakers to offer increasingly cost-competitive EV models,
supported by policies such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in the United States
which aims to improve charging infrastructure. In other regions, notably in Asia, battery
swapping presents a promising option to alleviate range anxiety for both cars and trucks.
By 2030, oil demand in the transport sector in the STEPS remains at current levels despite an
increase in passenger activity of more than 30% and of nearly 15% in freight activity. EVs are
largely responsible for this change, as their dissemination shifts an increasing share of energy
demand in transport from oil to electricity. The share of road transport activity accounted
for by EVs rises from 4% today to around 17% in 2030 in the STEPS, around 20% in the APS,
and nearly 30% in the NZE Scenario which leads to additional electricity demand of 850 TWh,

areas (Box 3.2). Public transportation continues to play a crucial role, with the world’s bus

Electrification and energy efficiency are the key pillars to decarbonise road transport. It also
plays a central part to decarbonise rail transport, with 75% of rail activity electrified by 2030
in the STEPS. Low-emissions fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen also contribute to
decarbonisation, particularly in non-road modes of transport such as aviation and shipping.
In aviation, sustainable aviation fuels have a pivotal role to reduce emissions, meeting 2% of
energy demand for aviation by 2030 and over 10% in 2050 in the STEPS. In the APS this rises
to 5%, and in the NZE Scenario to over 10% of aviation energy demand by 2030, slightly
increasing overall aviation costs (IEA, 2024c). In shipping, International Maritime
Organization (IMO) targets for decarbonisation play a central part in ammonia and hydrogen
taking a 4% share of shipping energy demand by 2030 in the APS, with low-emissions
methanol accounting for another 8% and bioenergy for a further 10%. The reduction in global
oil demand in road transport also contributes to lower emissions from shipping by decreasing
oil shipments. By 2030, lower global oil demand in the APS reduces energy demand from
international oil tankers by 15%.

Low-emissions fuel consumption in the transport sector is set to rise by 30% in 2030 and to
more than double by 2050 from current levels in the STEPS (Figure 3.10). Bioenergy plays a
significant role in this, particularly in shipping and aviation. In the APS, low-emissions fuels
help avoid 550 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) emissions in road transport by
2030, and additional bioenergy is used in subsequent years to meet announced pledges,
mostly in aviation and shipping. Hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels see substantial growth
as they become more cost competitive in this scenario, with levels of use rising from
7 petajoules (PJ) today to 900 PJ in 2030 and 13 500 PJ in 2050: most of the hydrogen is used
for road transport, and all of the ammonia is used in shipping. While low-emissions fuels are
crucial to decarbonise challenging sectors like aviation and shipping, energy efficiency
improvements remain vital, and they result in 2 100 PJ of avoided demand by 2030 in the
STEPS and 2 600 PJ in the APS in non-road transport sub-sectors, mostly thanks to new and
more efficient stock replacing older models.
Emissions reductions in shipping and aviation are driven in part by policy changes. The
European Union is setting the pace with its ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation that seeks to boost
the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels in the European Union by setting targets for a 6%
blend share by 2030 and a 20% share by 2035. The FuelEU Maritime Regulation meanwhile
targets a reduction of 80% in the emissions intensity of fuel used in shipping in the European
Union by 2050, while intergovernmental policies such as the IMO Energy Efficiency Design
Index, the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and the Carbon Intensity Indicator are also
set to drive significant efficiency improvements in shipping.
Box 3.2 ⊳

Micromobility and the role of e-bikes

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

More than 65 million e-bikes were sold worldwide in 2023, of which 80% were in China.
E-bike sales have already surpassed conventional two/three-wheelers, which sold
55 million units in 2023. E-bikes have rapidly gained popularity in urban and suburban
areas. They contribute to a sustainable transportation mix. IEA analysis suggests that ebikes displaced 70 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) of oil demand in 2023 by reducing the
use of cars. Their impact is set to broaden further in the years ahead (Figure 3.11).
E-bikes provide affordable private transport, solving the “last-mile” problem of public
transit by helping passengers to reach their destinations while also reducing local air
pollution. E-bike user surveys show that e-bikes typically are used to cover distances of
3-24 kilometres, and that they replace a wide range of other modes of passenger
transport in urban areas, including public transport, walking, non-electric cycling and
journeys by car (Bourne et al., 2020). E-bike sharing schemes, when complemented by
adequate cycling infrastructure, further add to the potential of e-bikes to reduce
emissions. Charging stations in urban areas are essential to encourage the widespread
adoption of e-bikes and to help with the management of e-bike parking area
consolidation. Currently, over 1 500 cities worldwide offer e-bike park-and-ride share
programmes (Bike Sharing World Map, 2022) (see Chapter 5).

Conventional cycling also has an important part to play in urban and suburban transport.
In Bogotá and Guangzhou, around 6% of passenger-kilometres travelled on bicycle lanes
would have otherwise been undertaken by car (ITDP, 2022). In Seville, construction of a
bicycle lane network led to increased cycling and public transit use, while the expansion
of the Vélib bike sharing network in Paris in recent years has contributed to cycling
becoming more popular than driving.

3.3.2

Buildings

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Energy demand in the buildings sector declined by 0.7% in 2023. After a decade when annual
growth averaged over 1%, the recent fall was primarily due to a warmer winter leading to
less demand for space heating, which outweighed increased demand in other end-uses.
Natural gas use fell the most in 2023, dropping by over 4%, which added to the cut in demand
seen in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Use of other fossil fuels in the buildings
sector also declined in 2023. By contrast, electricity use continued to rise with its share of
buildings sector demand at 37% in 2023, up from 31% in 2010, underpinned by expanding
use in appliances.
This decade, energy demand growth in the buildings sector slows slightly to under 1%
annually in the STEPS to reach 132 EJ in 2030 (Figure 3.12). This modest deceleration
continues after 2030, with annual growth averaging 0.7% from 2030 to 2050, when energy

demand in the sector reaches 153 EJ. However, demand falls by an annual average of 0.5%
in the APS to reach 120 EJ in 2030. It declines further in the NZE Scenario to just over 100 EJ
by 2030. These varied outcomes are primarily shaped by the pace of advances in access to
modern energy, with the faster shift away from highly inefficient traditional use of biomass
to clean cooking in the APS and the NZE Scenario which bring substantial energy savings as
well as social benefits (see Chapter 5). The wide variation across scenarios also reflects the
different pace at which mature technologies are rolled out for other end-uses, with faster
progress in the APS and NZE Scenario underpinned by higher levels of policy support.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Electricity use in the buildings sector rises significantly both as a share of energy consumed
and in absolute terms. In the STEPS, electricity increases to over 40% of energy consumed in
buildings in 2030 and over 50% in 2050. This equates to an increase of 10 EJ by 2030 and over
35 EJ by 2050, mostly in emerging market and developing economies. Mounting demand for
cooling and for data centres helps drive electricity demand growth (see Chapter 4,
section 4.6.1). In contrast, fossil fuel use in buildings declines from the mid-2020s. Natural
gas demand, which accounts for a larger share of energy demand in buildings than other
fossil fuels, peaks in the late 2020s in the STEPS: it declines sooner and faster in other
scenarios.
Energy use trends in the buildings sector vary sharply by economic grouping. The share of
advanced economies in total consumption in buildings falls from around 50% in 2000 to 30%
in 2050 in the STEPS (Figure 3.13). Demand from the buildings sector in advanced economies
114

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

is only slightly higher in 2030 than it was in 2023: it then declines at an average annual rate
of around 0.3% to 2050. Energy demand in the sector in emerging market and developing
economies, by contrast, increases by an annual average 1.5% to 2030 in the STEPS, and then
by 1.3% until 2050. As a result, emerging market and developing economies add over 30 EJ
to global energy demand in the buildings sector by 2050, including over 7 EJ in China, nearly
4 EJ in Southeast Asia and over 2 EJ in India. In the APS and NZE Scenario, this demand growth
slows after 2030, respectively averaging 0.9% and 0.3% annually.

Notes: AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. Appliance demand
includes cleaning, refrigeration and consumer electronics, but excludes space cooling. Heating demand is
space heating. Cleaning equipment includes washing machines, clothes dryers and dishwashers. Cooling
equipment refers to air conditioners only.

The balance of energy consumption in the buildings sector by end-use shifts significantly
from space heating to space cooling and appliances over the coming decades. In the STEPS,
space heating demand drops by nearly 6 EJ by 2050 in advanced economies as a result of
existing policies and incentives, and a warming climate. In the APS, demand falls by 13 EJ
reflecting new initiatives such as the European Union’s revised Energy Performance of
Buildings Directive, the 6th Strategic Energy Plan in Japan, and the Zero Emissions Building
Standard in the United States. In emerging market and developing economies, space heating
demand is heavily concentrated in a few large markets, notably China and Russia. Objectives
for new buildings and retrofits outlined in China’s Action Plan for Carbon Peaking help to
reduce heating demand in emerging market and developing economies in 2050 by nearly
2 EJ in the APS.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

115

Meanwhile demand for space cooling in emerging market and developing economies is set
to rise by nearly 10 EJ by 2050 in the STEPS. Driven by rising incomes, growing population
and a warming climate, it accounts for around 14% of total energy demand in buildings by
2050, up from below 7% today. Energy demand for use in other appliances rises more
moderately but from a higher base, increasing by 11 EJ by 2050 in emerging market and
developing economies. While partly due to population growth, the biggest driver is economic
growth leading to higher appliance ownership. In lower-middle income countries, such as
India and Indonesia, current ownership rates are often around a third of those in advanced
economies, and their rapid economic growth is set to reduce this gap significantly by
mid-century. Conversely, in upper-middle income countries, such as China and Brazil,
ownership rates for certain appliances, e.g. refrigerators and washing machines, are nearing
those in advanced economies.

Can new global initiatives moderate fast-growing cooling demand?
Momentum is picking up in efforts to moderate rapid growth in energy demand for cooling.
At the international level, dedicated fora have been established through the Buildings
Breakthrough, the Chaillot Declaration and Global Cooling Pledge. Many countries are now
assessing what measures should feature in national plans to manage growth in cooling
demand. Stringent minimum energy performance standards for air conditioners and
mandatory building codes for new construction are needed.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Space cooling has seen faster growth than any other major end-use in the buildings sector
since 2000, increasing an average of 4% per year. This continues in the STEPS through to
2050, with an annual average rise of 3.2%. Energy demand for cooling worldwide increases
by almost 4.5 EJ by 2035, which is more than all current electricity use in the Middle East.
Around 75% of this increased energy demand for cooling is in non-OECD Asia, with the largest
absolute growth in India and China. Mounting energy demand for cooling is the largest driver
of increasing peak electricity demand from buildings in emerging market and developing
economies (see Chapter 5, section 5.2.2). Ownership levels for air conditioners in emerging
market and developing economies rise from below 0.6 per household in 2023 to close to
1 per household by 2035, in line with the current level in advanced economies (Figure 3.14).
A warming climate also increases energy demand for cooling applications. Some regions are
more exposed than others, and rising demand could be amplified if extreme temperatures
become more common (see Chapter 4, section 4.6.2).
In the STEPS, energy demand growth for cooling is partly mitigated by energy efficiency
measures, with nearly all efficiency savings related to minimum performance standards for
air conditioners. While such standards are already widespread – covering around 90% of
global energy consumption from space cooling – many of these measures are in their infancy
and set requirements that fall far short of current potential. On a life cycle basis, efficient air
conditioners cost no more than less efficient options, and in some countries they cost less.
The APS reflects commitments from countries to raise energy performance standards over
time to garner this cost-effective potential.

Notes: Climate effect reflects higher utilisation rates of air conditioners due to higher temperatures, whereas
ownership rate reflects higher ownership level due to economic and population factors. Rising temperatures
increase cooling demand over time, but lower projected emissions decrease this climate effect in the APS
compared to the STEPS.

Even in the APS, residential cooling demand in emerging market and developing economies
triples from 2.6 EJ to 7.7 EJ by 2050. Among countries that have established net zero
emissions targets, pledges to cut cooling emissions by 2030 have so far focussed on appliance
efficiency. Few countries have set goals to improve building envelopes this decade, and less
than half of new construction in emerging market and developing economies in 2030 is
compliant with building codes in the APS. However, there are signs of change. Under the
Buildings Breakthrough initiative, 27 countries committed to make nearly zero-energy and
resilient buildings the norm by 2030. This includes 15 emerging market and developing
economies, the majority of which currently lack mandatory building codes for new
construction. More recently, 70 countries signed the Chaillot Declaration, which aims to
improve the resilience and efficiency of new buildings, as well as material efficiency and
passive performance of building retrofits. This follows a variety of recent national initiatives
that address the efficiency of both building envelopes and technical building systems, e.g.
new national cooling strategies in Cambodia, Viet Nam and Kenya. Translating these
initiatives into effective national policies can help mitigate increased energy demand for
cooling applications. In the NZE Scenario, where minimum energy performance standards
and mandatory codes for new construction are matched by policies that significantly boost
retrofit rates, the demand increase by 2050 is limited to 90%.

Industry

The industry sector produces basic materials used across the global economy, including the
materials required for decarbonisation. However, it is also the most CO2-intensive end-use
sector, accounting for almost half of total final consumption emissions. Industrial energy use
is concentrated in emerging market and developing economies, which account for more than
70% of the global total. Energy demand from industry increased by 2% in 2023 and emissions
by less than 1%.
Fossil fuels continue to play an important role in the industry sector in the STEPS, meeting a
broadly constant share of demand (Figure 3.15). Coal is widely used for steel and cement
production: its use begins to fall towards the end of the decade in some regions with large
industrial consumption, notably China, Europe, Japan, Korea and United States, but global
natural gas consumption rises moderately as additional LNG capacities come online.
However, fossil fuel use does reduce significantly in the APS and NZE Scenario after 2030
(Box 3.3).

Notes: CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage; NEU = non-energy use. Where low-emissions hydrogen
is produced and consumed onsite at an industrial facility, the fuel input, such as electricity or natural gas, is

The share of electricity in industry energy demand increases gradually over time, rising from
22% in 2023 to 25% in 2030 in the STEPS and to 27% in the APS by 2030. More than half of
the additional electricity demand is in China, where electricity-intensive clean energy

intensive industries, rising from 5 EJ to 7.5 EJ between 2023 and 2030. By contrast, bioenergy
demand in STEPS only increases by 10% to 5.5 EJ.
The industry sector is reliant on high-temperature heat to drive chemical processes,
particularly in energy-intensive industries (Figure 3.16). These industries accounted for
almost three-quarters of energy use in the sector in 2023, but only around one-fifth of the
value added. Technology options to avoid emissions from fossil fuel use for hightemperature applications mostly are not yet mature. Yet, many technologies are now
advancing beyond the prototype stage: most of them use CCUS and electrolytic hydrogen,
but some involve direct electrification, for example, electric steam crackers. Direct
electrification is more straightforward for non-energy-intensive industries: around half of the
thermal energy that they require is used at less than 100 degrees Celsius (°C) and can be
supplied at competitive prices by heat pumps, which can also be competitive at higher
temperatures (in the 100-200 °C range). Resistance heating, bioenergy or low-emissions
hydrogen are alternative solutions: their growing use plays a major part in reducing unabated
fossil fuel use to 20% by 2050 in the APS and phasing it out almost completely in the
NZE Scenario.

Current project announcements featuring near-zero emissions technologies fall short of
what is required in the NZE Scenario. For example, only 19 Mt CO2 of CCUS capacity is
installed in the STEPS by 2030, which is 31% of the amount captured in the APS and just 7%
of what is needed in the NZE Scenario. Asset lifetimes in heavy industry, particularly steel
and cement plants, are usually at least around 25 years, so changing technologies is a slow

process. For example, while additions of conventional capacity without abatement potential
end in the NZE Scenario by 2030, slow turnover of the stock of older capacity means that it
takes until after 2040 for most of the stock to be using innovative technologies. Investment
certainty is needed to enable near-zero emissions technology projects to go ahead. Some
countries are moving in that direction: for example, Germany launched first carbon contracts
for difference auctions in 2024 to reduce price risks for energy-intensive industries, while the
Green Innovation Fund in Japan will support the decarbonisation of manufacturing-related
industries until 2030.

Increasing recycling potential through chemical processes

Recent policy initiatives stimulated over 90 countries to pass a full or partial ban on
single-use plastics and more than 20 to establish recycling targets and collection policies.
Nonetheless, plastic waste collection for recycling has increased only relatively modestly:
12% of global plastic waste was collected for recycling in 2010, which rose to just 19% in
2023, with marked differences between the collection rates in advanced economies
(27%) and emerging market and developing economies (13%). Policy momentum would
be boosted by the conclusion of the United Nations’ treaty to end plastic pollution, which
has been under negotiation since 2022.

Most recycled waste today is processed mechanically 3, but the variety of plastics being
used limits the growth potential of this technology. 4 Chemical recycling is gaining traction
as a complementary technology with the potential to raise recycling rates above the
mechanical recycling potential. It is currently used to process around 1.3 million tonnes
(Mt) of plastic waste each year, and this rises in the APS to 6 Mt by 2035, or 5% of total
recycled waste (Figure 3.17). In the NZE Scenario, chemical recycling is widely adopted in
advanced economies and leads by 2050 to the recycling of 23 Mt of plastic waste,
displacing an additional 0.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) of oil beyond what can be
achieved through mechanical processing alone. Advanced economies nearing their
mechanical recycling limits are well-positioned to lead in adopting chemical recycling. Its
uptake at scale is dependent on investment in research, development and deployment
to improve the efficiency of chemical recycling technologies and to reduce their costs.
This would benefit not only advanced economies but also emerging market and
developing economies as they reach the limits of their mechanical recycling capabilities
in the coming decades.
Yet however efficient plastic recycling becomes, significant amounts of virgin plastic will
still be needed because recycled plastic is not suitable for all uses and industries. Even in
the NZE Scenario, oil use in the chemical sub-sector remains close to the current level,
over 12 mb/d, in 2050. Reducing emissions from continuing plastics production calls for
a range of measures to reduce demand for plastic, advance the development of
bioplastics (within biomass availability constraints), electrify the steam crackers used to
produce plastics, and make use of CCUS. (For more details about plastics, see The Future
of Petrochemicals [IEA, 2018]).

3.4

Electricity

The electricity sector is the largest emitting sector in the world today, accounting for 36% of
global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023. Electricity demand has grown at nearly twice
the rate of overall energy demand over the last decade and is accelerating as the global
economy becomes increasingly electrified. Clean energy transitions are underway, with
solar PV and wind regularly setting records for growth, helped by policy support, low
technology costs and the widespread potential for their deployment. Coal nevertheless
remains the largest source of electricity, and fossil fuels still account for 60% of global
electricity supply. The speed of clean energy transitions in the electricity sector in the years
3 Mechanical recycling involves the processing of plastic waste without altering the molecular structure.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Chemical recycling changes the structure of the polymeric waste and transforms it into chemical building
blocks, including monomers, which can then be used as raw material in chemical processes, reducing the need
for virgin fossil resources. Some examples are gasification, pyrolysis and depolymerisation.

4 The wide variety of plastic compositions, additives and manufacturing methods makes it difficult to process

them together effectively. Different types of plastics can contaminate each other, leading to lower quality
recycled materials. Also, food residues, dirt and other contaminants can affect the quality of recycled plastic.

3.4.1

Electricity demand

Global electricity demand rose by more than 2.5% in 2023, a rate similar to the average over
the past decade. Two-thirds of the increase in demand since 2013 was from China, driven by
electrification of industrial processes and by growth in electricity demand for appliances and
cooling. Other regions where demand has increased rapidly include India, the Middle East
and parts of Southeast Asia, where buildings have played a major role in electricity demand
growth. Uncertainties around electricity demand growth are explored in Chapter 4.
From 2023 to 2030, average annual electricity demand growth accelerates to 3.3% in the
STEPS, over 3.5% in the APS, and 4.5% in the NZE Scenario. From 2023 to 2050, these growth
rates range from 2.4% in the STEPS to over 3% in the APS and 3.5% in the NZE Scenario.
Emerging market and developing economies account for about 70% of the additional
electricity demand through to 2050 across all scenarios (Figure 3.18). China alone contributes
about 45% of the increase to 2030, and around 25% between 2030 and 2050. India becomes
the third-largest electricity consumer in the world by 2050 on the back of growth in demand
of over 4% a year in all scenarios. Other emerging market and developing economies also
experience robust demand growth, while advanced economies see lower annual average
growth rates through to 2050 which range from 1.8% in the STEPS to 2.6% in the
NZE Scenario.

Global electricity demand nearly doubles by 2050 in the STEPS, more than doubles in the APS
and increases 2.5-times in the NZE Scenario. These are big differences: the additional
demand in the APS compared with the STEPS is roughly equivalent to the current combined
electricity demand of China and India, while the additional demand in the NZE Scenario
compared with the APS is roughly equivalent to the current demand of the European Union
and United States combined. By 2030, the share of electricity in total final consumption
reaches 23% in the STEPS, up from 20% today: it reaches around 30% in China, Japan and
South Africa. In the APS, the share of electricity rises to 25%, and in the NZE Scenario it
reaches nearly 30%.
In advanced economies, ambitious policies supporting the adoption of EVs drive 40% of the
additional electricity demand until 2035 in the STEPS (Figure 3.19). Heat pumps, appliances
and air conditioning units also help drive up demand, as do the burgeoning power demands
of artificial intelligence and data centres. Much of the additional demand projected in the
APS comes from the industrial sector, where an increasing number of demonstration projects
use electricity in energy-intensive industries while at the same time the electrification of light
industries proceeds more rapidly than in the STEPS.

EVs drive electricity demand growth in advanced economies; economic progress raises
demand for appliances and light industries in emerging market and developing economies

In emerging market and developing economies, the building sector contributes the majority
of additional growth by 2035. Increasing ownership of appliances and rising demand for air
conditioning also make major contributions to rising demand, together with the
electrification of industrial production, especially in China. In the APS, more stringent
minimum energy performance standards and widespread development of energy ratings for

appliances and air conditioners reduce buildings electricity demand by 10% in 2035
compared with the STEPS.
Buildings remains the sector that uses the most electricity in both the STEPS and APS, with
the industry sector in second place. In the NZE Scenario, however, industry becomes the
largest sectoral user of electricity by late 2020s as a result of the rapid electrification of light
industries and the use of electricity in onsite hydrogen production for steel and chemicals.
Rising EV sales are responsible for over 20% of total electricity demand growth by 2050 in
the STEPS, and for an even higher proportion in the APS and NZE Scenario. Hydrogen
production via electrolysis also increases electricity demand by 7 000 TWh in the APS by
2050, or about 25% of current total electricity demand, and by 12 000 TWh in the
NZE Scenario: this accounts by itself for 20% of the increase in the APS, and 30% in the
NZE Scenario.
Box 3.4 ⊳

How will electrification change demand patterns?

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Increasing electrification, especially of new end-uses, is set to change the magnitude and
patterns of hourly electricity demand. Electricity load patterns will look very different in
2050 from today’s limited variations across the day, but action can be taken to manage
them: heat pumps and air conditioners will increase winter and summer demand, while
EV charging will drive a surge in the evening. In the European Union, evening peak
demand in 2050 is set to dominate the daily pattern of demand, significantly changing
the daily profile that is visible today (Figure 3.20). This reflects to a large extent growth
in EV ownership: while EVs account for around 22% of daily electricity demand by 2050
in the STEPS, their share in the evening is much higher at almost 30%. In India, the daily
variability of electricity demand averaged 15% in 2023 and is set to almost triple by 2050.
Cooling will become the most important driver of daily variability in demand, though
higher levels of appliance ownership and EVs are set to affect it as well.
However, if well-incentivised and planned, the end-uses that are on course to generate
peaks in the future can also provide demand management solutions that lower those
peaks. By 2050, solar PV capacity is sufficiently large to drive electricity prices down for
several hours a day, every day: this could be reflected in retail tariffs, which could in turn
incentivise a shift to the hours when tariffs are low and reshape demand patterns.
Demand flexibility can thus be planned in advance and managed, and our scenarios
assume that this is what happens. EVs, heating and cooling provide the largest potential,
and contribute to 80% of activated demand flexibility. Around 10% of electricity demand
is shifted over the day in both the European Union and India. Evening peaks are reduced
by up to 20% and midday consumption increased by around 20%, maximising efficient
integration of renewables and reducing the need for peaking power plants (see
Chapter 5, Box 5.2). The increasing adoption of smart meters and other advanced
technologies as well as dynamic pricing mechanisms is essential if electricity demand is
to be successfully managed in this way in response to grid needs.

Electricity supply

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In 2023, fossil fuels provided 60% of global electricity supply — their lowest share of the total
in the past 50 years. Coal accounted for the largest share of the total, 36%, with natural gas
also playing a major part at 22%. Beyond fossil fuels, nuclear power declined slightly to a 9%
share, which is half as much as 30 years ago. Despite a decline in hydropower output,
renewables reached 30% of global electricity generation for the first time, with wind and
solar PV together providing 13%, double the level just five years before.
Renewables, led by solar PV and wind, are set to play a much larger role in power systems
over the next decade and beyond. In the STEPS, solar PV and wind combined generation
nearly triples from 2023 to 2030, accounting for over 90% of electricity supply growth and
overtaking coal, which peaks around 2025 and then starts a steady decline (Figure 3.21). By
2035, solar PV and wind provide over 40% of electricity generation, a level that few countries
have managed to date. Increased use of solar and wind on this scale requires action to
modernise grids and expand power system flexibility, including through the development of
multiple forms of energy storage (see Chapter 5). Hydropower output depends on
precipitation and air temperatures and therefore varies from year to year, but the overall
trend is one of slow growth. Nuclear power also steadily increases at the global level, while
natural gas-fired power reaches a peak in the late 2020s before stabilising at around the
current level.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

More ambitious scenarios rely heavily on renewables to accelerate transitions. In the APS,
the expansion of wind and solar PV is faster than in the STEPS and is complemented by
stronger growth of other renewables and nuclear power: this drives down unabated coalfired power by almost 60% by 2035 and cuts natural gas use by 20%. In the NZE Scenario,
additional renewables, further nuclear power, and the development and deployment of
carbon capture technologies and low-emissions hydrogen fully decarbonise the electricity
sector by 2040: unabated coal is fully phased out by this date, and unabated natural gas is
reduced by 80%.

After decades of fossil fuels generating most of the world’s electricity,

and marine; other low-emissions includes fossil fuels with CCUS, hydrogen and ammonia. Other includes nonrenewable waste.

Many governments around the world have policies in place to help drive clean energy
transitions in the power sector. Alongside electricity security, a key priority is the provision
of support to expand renewable energy, which is often linked to specific targets. By 2023,
152 countries had set renewable electricity targets (REN21, 2024). A pledge to triple
renewables capacity was announced by governments at the COP28. Many major economies
now aim to increase renewable energy by 50% or more from its 2023 level by 2030, either in
terms of capacity or share of electricity generation (Figure 3.22). Targets are set out in
documents such as national energy and climate plans in the European Union, the 6th
Strategic Energy Plan in Japan, the 10th Basic Plan in Korea, the 14th Five-Year Plan in China,
the National Electricity Plan in India, the Development Plan in Indonesia, and various statelevel renewable portfolio standards in the United States. Korea and India aim to more than
double and Indonesia aims to more than triple the role of renewables by 2030.

Two clear priority areas have emerged in electricity sector policies: support for

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Notes: Renewables targets estimated based on regional and national policies in the United States, European
Union and China. *The renewable capacity target year in India is 2032 and in Indonesia is 2033.

A second key policy priority for many governments is the need to reduce or phase out the
use of unabated coal-fired power generation. This reflects a recognition that the transition
away from unabated coal is critical to any clean energy transition. Currently more than 95%
of electricity generated from coal plants is covered by phase-out commitments or net zero
emissions pledges. However, while many countries have net zero emissions targets,
countries responsible for just 10% of electricity generation from coal have national plans in
place to phase out the unabated use of coal. Although countries responsible for a further
20% have agreed internationally to phase out unabated coal or not to develop new unabated
coal-fired power, there is a strong case for more to be done to announce and implement
specific plans for coal in the context of wider emissions reduction goals. Austria, Belgium,
Portugal and Sweden have already phased out coal-fired power. The United Kingdom closed
its last coal-fired power plant in September 2024 and Slovakia aims to do so by the end of
2024.

Beyond renewables and coal, there is widening policy support for energy storage, including
the G7 agreeing to contribute to a global target of 1 500 GW of installed capacity by 2030, a
sixfold increase from the level in 2023, with the aim of strengthening energy security and
helping to integrate rising shares of renewables. Although pumped hydro and other forms of
storage remain important, battery storage is poised to provide the lion’s share of energy
storage expansion in support of the target to triple renewables capacity by 2030 (IEA, 2024d).
Installed battery storage capacity rises from almost 90 GW in 2023 to 850 GW in 2030 in the
STEPS, over 1 000 GW in the APS and over 1 250 GW in the NZE Scenario, with the average
duration increasing from around two hours currently to three hours in 2030.
Policy support for nuclear power has also risen in recent years. In December 2023, more than
20 countries pledged to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050. Notable developments in
several European countries include extending operations for existing reactors in Belgium,
lifting a ban on developing new nuclear plants in Switzerland, the identification of new builds
as a priority in Sweden and Poland, and confirmation of the importance of nuclear in France.
Many countries are showing interest in small modular reactors and the first projects outside
China and Russia are expected to come online around 2030.

In many countries, including China, the European Union and the United States, the expansion
of wind and solar PV in the STEPS is able to meet all electricity demand growth over the next
decade and also to displace some fossil fuel use (Figure 3.23). While renewables expand
128

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

strongly in the STEPS, they are not able to meet all demand growth in India or other emerging
market and developing economies to 2035, and those countries see increases in the use of
coal and natural gas in their power systems. In the APS, faster renewables deployment and
more robust action on energy efficiency mean that low-emissions sources of electricity are
able to meet all electricity demand growth in nearly all major economies. While limitations
of land availability present a challenge to the rapid expansion of renewables in some
countries, globally there is more than enough available space for all solar PV and wind
needed by 2050 in all our scenarios (IEA, 2023).
The share of renewables – including solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, geothermal and marine –
is set to increase significantly in most regions by 2035. In the European Union, it rises to over
70% of electricity generation by 2035 in the STEPS, which is almost in line with what is needed
in advanced economies overall in the NZE Scenario, and to over 80% in the APS, which would
deliver what is required by the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.24). The United States currently has a
lower share of renewables in its electricity mix, and it makes up ground in the STEPS: further
action to fulfil announced pledges, as in the APS, would not quite reach the NZE pathway,
but would get it much closer. In emerging market and developing economies, China is set to
obtain two-thirds of its generation from renewables by 2035 in the STEPS: another 10%
would match the average rate needed in the NZE Scenario. India also makes significant gains,
with renewables reaching 50% of electricity generation in 2035. Renewable energy
technologies can also be deployed to produce low-emissions hydrogen, and in some cases
individual projects may produce both electricity and hydrogen (Box 3.5).

Global coal-fired power generation is set to peak around 2025 in the STEPS, with continued
growth in the near term in China, India and Southeast Asia offset by reductions in the
European Union, United States and other advanced economies (Figure 3.25). By 2030,
however, coal use for power generation starts to decline in most regions, and by 2035 coalfired power is down by one-third compared to today. In the APS, the fulfilment of all
announced pledges, including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), means that coalfired power declines by more than 50% by 2035, with the biggest changes compared with
the STEPS in China, India and other emerging market and developing economies. The
NZE Scenario calls for an even steeper 85% reduction of unabated coal-fired generation by
2035 and a complete phase out by 2040. In the APS and NZE Scenario, the early retirement
of coal plants accelerates, with electricity security maintained through an increase in energy
storage capacity and in power system flexibility, some of which comes from demand-side
management (see Chapter 5).

Offshore wind for electricity or hydrogen production?

Offshore wind is a growing industry and is projected to capture an increasing amount of
investment in 2030 and beyond in all scenarios. Its prospects are helped by falling
technology costs and government policy support, as set out for example in the Ostend
Declaration signed by the North Sea countries in Europe, the PDP8 in Viet Nam and the
Offshore Wind Energy Roadmap in Colombia. Offshore wind projects today are focussed

130

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

on generating electricity, but they are also increasingly being considered as a future
means to produce low-emissions hydrogen.
Global offshore wind capacity is projected in the STEPS to increase from 73 GW in 2023
to 560 GW in 2035 and more than 1 000 GW in 2050, of which only 2% in 2050 is
projected to be dedicated for hydrogen production. With faster clean energy transitions
in the APS and NZE Scenario, the demand for both low-emissions electricity and hydrogen
increases. Offshore wind capacity reaches 1 600 GW in 2050 in the APS, of which 15% is
dedicated to hydrogen production, and 1 950 GW in the NZE Scenario, of which 20% is
for hydrogen production.
Offshore wind projects can be designed to produce either hydrogen or electricity or both.
The optimal choice of design varies with the surrounding energy system. In remote areas,
projects devoted entirely to hydrogen production could be advantageous because it
might be cheaper to transport hydrogen over long distances than it would be to transmit
electricity. In areas that are close to existing grids, it might make most sense to focus on
the production of electricity. In some areas, hybrid projects could prove to be the best
option, if electricity market designs provide the right incentives. Hybrid projects can offer
opportunities to optimise their value by selling into electricity or hydrogen markets. In
the North Sea, hybrid projects are now under consideration by a variety of interested
parties including national governments, private funds and consortia like the North Sea
Wind Power Hub, which brings together leading transmission system operators in North
Sea countries.
Delivering either electricity or hydrogen or both requires significant infrastructure
investment to cover the costs of electrical equipment, subsea cables, pipes, pumps,
offshore platforms and the production equipment itself. Hybrid projects would be
especially complex and expensive, potentially costing tens of billions USD, and offshore
hydrogen production relies on new and unproven technology. If such projects are to be
developed, clear long-term planning and investment priorities will be critical, and a
variety of governments, transmission system operators, developers and investors will
need to work together and accept a share of the risks involved.

Power sector CO2 emissions

Power sector CO2 emissions were 15.3 Gt in 2023, up from 14.9 Gt in 2022, and accounted
for 40% of the global energy-related total. Emissions would have fallen in 2023 from their
2022 level without a hydropower generation shortfall caused by droughts (IEA, 2024e).
Growing demand for electricity means that emissions have risen in recent years despite
decreasing carbon intensity in the power sector. Since 2010, around 70% of total power
sector emissions are from coal, but the electricity mixes of both advanced economies and
emerging market and developing economies now have CO2 intensities 30-60% lower than
that of coal. In the same period, the electricity mix of advanced economies has been on
average one-third less carbon intensive and has been decarbonising more than three-times
faster than that of emerging market and developing economies.
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

131

In the STEPS, emissions fall nearly 30% by 2035 and nearly 50% by 2050, getting back by 2050
to their level in 1994 (Figure 3.26). By 2035, CO2 emissions from emerging market and
developing economies are more than six-times higher than those from advanced economies
(compared to 1.4-times higher in 2010), and almost half of emerging market and developing
economies emissions are from China. However, power sector emissions in emerging market
and developing economies peak in the mid-2020s in both the STEPS and APS. In the APS, CO2
emissions fall 50% by 2035 and more than 80% by 2050, driven by reduced use of coal and
natural gas for power generation. In the NZE Scenario, CO2 emissions fall 80% by 2035 and
reach net zero globally just before 2045. Shifting away from coal is at the heart of measures
to achieve net zero emissions in power systems by 2035 in advanced economies and by 2040
in China. As coal is phased out, natural gas becomes the main source of emissions.

After 2030, the level of investment in almost all low-emissions sources of electricity stabilises

supply by this time, especially in advanced economies. However, the level of investment in
grids and batteries increases to facilitate their crucial role in the increasing levels of
electrification of the end-uses. In the STEPS, investment in grids nearly doubles by 2050 from
its current level, while investment in batteries increases 4.6-times. In the APS, investment in

Emerging market and developing economies account for more than 60% of growth in global
power sector investment in the STEPS through to 2030 and beyond. China currently accounts
for more than 60% of all emerging market and developing economies power sector
investment, and its share does not drop below 40% through to 2030 in any of the three
scenarios. In the APS, emerging market and developing economies more than double their
average annual investment of USD 560 billion between 2019 to 2023 to USD 1.2 trillion by
2030, with an almost 80% increase by 2030 even in the STEPS. Advanced economies see a
slower increase than emerging market and developing economies in the APS, but their level
of investment in 2030 doubled in the APS and is about 55% above the average level in 20192023 in the STEPS.
Box 3.6 ⊳

Can the electricity grid expand at the necessary pace?

Significant grid enhancements are required in each scenario to meet growing electricity
demand and to manage the rapidly increasing deployment of renewable energy sources.
New transmission lines are essential to connect large-scale wind and solar PV projects to
demand centres, sometimes over long distances. Distribution lines have to be expanded
to accommodate rising electricity demand and increases in distributed renewables.
Increased interconnections within and between countries and regions are needed to
improve electricity security and to facilitate the integration of further potential flexibility
providers and distributed energy resources. From 2023 to 2030, global grid line lengths
are projected to increase by approximately 15% in the STEPS and closer to 20% in the
NZE Scenario.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Over the past three years, global grid investment has increased at an average annual rate
of nearly 7%, to reach record highs. However, this has not prevented connection queues
and grid congestion caused by delayed grid extensions. These have arisen because it can
take over a decade to complete grid projects, which is much longer than is needed to
complete the renewable energy projects that grid improvements are designed to serve.
Electricity grid projects are highly complex and involve extensive permitting and
construction processes. Comprehensive line route plans and reports must be prepared,
conditions and specifications assessed, and stakeholders engaged. The process can be
further complicated by local opposition to proposed line routes, tight supply chains and
a shortage of qualified staff.
By 2030, transmission grid extension rates are projected to increase by 70% in the STEPS,
more than 90% in APS and around 110% in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.28). In distribution,
it remains nearly the same rate in the STEPS, as advanced economies are also extending
through line capacity upgrades, with a slight increase of 3% in the APS and over 10% in
the NZE Scenario. Most of these increases are needed to meet rising demand and
connect new customers in emerging market and developing economies, but some of the
investment is needed to upgrade or replace ageing grids: this is especially the case in
advanced economies, where most of the grids were built many decades ago.

To effectively enable clean energy transitions, the pace of
electricity grid replacements and extensions must accelerate
Notes: km = kilometres; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies. 2019-2023e: values for
replacements are estimated for all historical years based on the age of infrastructure.

Long-term grid planning, incorporating forward planning in supply and demand, is
essential if delays are to be avoided. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for
regulatory authorities, network operators and investors are vital, along with streamlined
permitting processes and procedures. Effective and binding deadlines could be used to
provide legal certainty to network operators and investors about the timely completion
of approval procedures, and high priority projects could be expedited by designating
"infrastructure corridors" that allow for quick initial permitting decisions. Anticipatory
investment can help network operators achieve predictable and timely cost recognition
and prevent further delays. Regulatory authorities could also help by developing new
ways to boost innovative and digital investment, such as output-based regulations that
favour efficient solutions. Many countries are developing initiatives that are designed to
speed up processes and improve the current position: examples include the European
Union Action Plan for Grids and the Coordinated Interagency Transmission
Authorizations and Permits Program in the United States.

Fuels

Fossil fuels met just under 80% of global energy demand in 2023, a share that has fallen very
gradually since 2011, when it stood at 83%. Aggregate fossil fuel demand has continued to
accompany broader economic growth, but in some areas this relationship is starting to
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

loosen. This is particularly the case in advanced economies, which have seen their economies
grow by 20% over the past ten years while fossil fuel use has contracted by nearly 10%,
helped by investment in clean energy technologies, rising shares of services in the economy
and efficiency improvements.
In emerging market and developing economies, on the other hand, increasing energy needs
have continued to push up fossil fuel use. Over the past ten years, their populations have
swelled by 720 million people, they have experienced a 50% increase in economic growth
and industrial output has risen by 40%. Floor space in buildings has increased by 40 000
square kilometres – enough to cover the entirety of the Netherlands – and fossil fuel
consumption increased 25%. Nonetheless, per capita fossil fuel use in emerging market and
developing economies remains at less than half the level of advanced economies; if emerging
market and developing economies were to match this level, global fossil fuel use would be
almost double what it is today.
In the STEPS, the correlation between global GDP and fossil fuel consumption seen in
previous decades loosens in the years ahead, and demand for each of the fossil fuels peaks
by 2030. Annual investment in fossil fuels falls from just over USD 1 trillion today to
USD 650 billion in the STEPS in 2050 and drops to USD 90 billion in the NZE Scenario
(Figure 3.29). Low-emissions fuels offer a route to diversification, and in the APS and
NZE Scenario they become essential parts of the clean energy economy.

Global oil markets continue to evolve and rebalance amid shifts in geographical and sectoral
supply and demand. Demand in 2023 surpassed the previous peak set in 2019, increasing by
nearly 2 mb/d from 2022 levels to reach 99 mb/d, of which China contributed 1.5 mb/d.
Transport accounted for a large share of the global increase: demand for road passenger cars
increased by nearly 600 thousand barrels per day (kb/d), while fuel use for aviation increased
by 1 000 kb/d after flight activity eclipsed pre-pandemic levels. Demand for oil from
petrochemicals increased by 500 kb/d in 2023, almost double the average growth over the
last 5 years. All of the growth on the supply side was met by non-OPEC sources, primarily
from the United States where over 40% of production comes from tight oil plays.
Demand growth is slowing noticeably in 2024 and is expected to be less than 1 mb/d for the
year as a whole. This pattern of slowing growth continues in the STEPS: the trajectory for oil
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

demand between 2023 and 2035 in the STEPS remains broadly unchanged from the
WEO-2023, and, as before, demand peaks before 2030. By 2050, oil demand is around
6 mb/d lower than in 2023, driven primarily by lower levels of demand in transport.

Demand
In the STEPS, global oil demand peaks before 2030 at just less than 102 mb/d, and then falls
back to 2023 levels of 99 mb/d by 2035 (Figure 3.30). Overall oil consumption is pulled down
by reduced demand for oil in road transport. Surging EV sales since 2015 have already
displaced around 1.0 mb/d of gasoline and diesel demand, and EVs avoid a further 12 mb/d
of oil demand growth for road transport between 2023 and 2035 in the STEPS: the net result
is a 2.5 mb/d contraction in oil use for road transport over this period. Fuel switching and
efficiency gains reduce oil use in the buildings sector, which contracts by 1.4 mb/d. These
declines are offset by a 6.2 mb/d increase in the use of oil in aviation and petrochemical
production between 2023 and 2035.

In the APS, oil demand falls by 17% in 2035 relative to 2023 levels. An additional 135 million
EVs are on the road by 2035 compared to the STEPS. A doubling in the plastics recycling rate
and material efficiency gains in chemicals between 2023 and 2035 arrest some of the growth
in petrochemical demand. In the NZE Scenario, oil demand drops to 58 mb/d by 2035, with
1 350 million EVs on the road while the plastic recycling rates increase slightly compared to
the APS.
138

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

In emerging market and developing economies, oil demand growth in the STEPS slows from
1.8% a year in the 2015-2023 period to 1% a year in the 2023-2035 period. India sees the
largest increase in oil demand over this period with a rise of 1.9 mb/d. Oil demand in China
rises by just under 1 mb/d, with declines in road transport offset by growth of 1.5 mb/d in
the petrochemicals sector (Box 3.7). China is on track to overtake the United States as the
world’s largest oil consuming country by 2030. In Central and South America, Africa, Middle
East and Eurasia, demand continues to grow to 2050, and it accounts for around one-third
of total global demand by 2050, compared with 22% today.
In advanced economies, the STEPS sees an acceleration in the decline in oil demand that has
been evident since 2005 (Figure 3.31). In Europe, the share of internal combustion engine
(ICE) vehicles in total car sales falls sharply: over 20% of cars sold today are battery electric
or plug-in hybrids, and this increases in the STEPS to 90% by 2035. In North America, the
share of EVs in total car sales grows from around 10% today to about 70% by 2035, mostly
as a result of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules recently introduced in the
United States and the Electric Vehicle Availability Standards in Canada. These trends
accelerate in the APS and NZE Scenario: by 2035, the overall share of EVs in car sales in
advanced economies grows to almost 90% in the APS and to almost 100% in the
NZE Scenario.

Demand for petrochemicals in China

China is the world’s largest consumer of petrochemicals, and its level of consumption is
continuing to rise. Rapid increase in China’s clean technology manufacturing – mainly
EVs, wind turbines and PV panels – is an important driver and accounts for around a
quarter of the demand growth for plastics since 2019. In a bid to improve self-sufficiency,
China has invested heavily in domestic production of plastics. This has helped to reduce
polyolefin imports from over 30% of requirements in 2019 to around 20% in 2023, while
also supporting expanding demand for plastics.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Notes: mb/d = million barrels per day; EU = European Union. Chemicals feedstock demand does not
include demand for aromatics production in refineries.

The increase of petrochemicals production in China has been a key factor in recent oil
market trends, displacing petrochemical output in other regions and offsetting demand
reductions in other sectors (Figure 3.32). Oil demand for use as a petrochemical
feedstock in China increased by over 1.5 mb/d between 2019 and 2023, which is 20%
more than overall global oil demand growth in the same period. Alone the
petrochemicals sector in China now uses more oil than the whole of Japan, which is the
world’s fifth-largest oil consumer. Almost half of the demand growth, mainly for naphtha
and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), has been met by increased refinery outputs, and the
remaining demand is met by imports. The rise in domestic production of plastics reduced
imports of plastics, mainly from the Middle East, Korea and United States, and an
increase in imports of lower value crude oil or refined products that can be used to
produce higher value chemicals, mainly from the Middle East and Russia.
140

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Oil demand growth in China continues to be driven by increasing petrochemicals
production for the next ten years. Even as overall oil demand peaks, its use as a chemical
feedstock in China continues to rise, reaching around 5 mb/d by 2035. Domestic
refineries cannot entirely satisfy this growth, and so naphtha and LPG imports double to
almost 2.3 mb/d over the same period. Higher recycling rates in the APS reduce demand
by almost 10% in 2035 but do not halt the growth trend.

3

Supply
The United States has dominated recent global oil supply growth, accounting for over half of
the increase in production since 2010. In the STEPS, growth in US production continues at a
slower pace through the rest of the decade and contracts by around 0.25 mb/d each year on
average between 2030 and 2050. Brazil, Argentina and Guyana add more than 2.5 mb/d to
supply by 2035, expanding current fields and capitalising on recent discoveries. In the APS,
production starts to fall across the board from about 2030: Central and South America is the
only region that sees growth in production between 2023 and 2030 before declining
(Figure 3.33).

Non-OPEC countries led oil supply growth over the past decade, which continues in the
STEPS through the 2020s; production declines across the board after 2030 in the APS

The volume of crude production by members of OPEC and Russia reached a high point of
around 47 mb/d in 2018 but has come under pressure since then as output from other
countries has risen faster than demand: effective OPEC spare capacity is now around 6 mb/d.
Supply is held relatively constant at a level between 42-44 mb/d in the STEPS through the
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

141

projection period. In the APS, supply from OPEC and Russia falls by close to 1 mb/d per year
on average through to 2040 and by around 500 kb/d from 2040 to 2050. The overall share of
OPEC in global oil supply nonetheless rises from 34% today to 41% in 2050, similar to levels
reached in the STEPS, as supply from other producer countries falls faster. Russian oil
production showed initial resilience against sanctions, and the ramp-up of the giant Vostok
project manages to partly offset losses at mature oil fields. Production reaches a maximum
level of around 11 mb/d this decade.

Refining and trade
Refineries are facing a significant adjustment period as the engine of past demand growth –
road transport fuels – is projected to sputter in the years ahead. A peak in motor gasoline
demand is coming into view and, in the STEPS, peak diesel demand is projected before 2030,
though middle distillates are propped up by continued growth in demand for jet kerosene.
Overall, oil product demand increasingly narrows toward petrochemical feedstocks, which
are the only source of oil product demand growth between 2023 and 2035 apart from
aviation fuels (Figure 3.34).

Middle distillates such as diesel and gasoline fall much more sharply in the APS
and NZE Scenario than petrochemical feedstocks

This evolution in oil product demand across all scenarios creates an overhang of gasoline
refining capacity and favours refineries that are closely integrated with petrochemical plants.
Such facilities are primarily based in Asia and the Middle East, and also benefit from proximity
to resilient sources of demand. Refiners in Europe are more exposed to the risks from
changing product demand patterns, and some of them are therefore making a strategic shift
into biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen and plastic recycling. In the STEPS, global refinery
142

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

capacity sees net growth of around 2 mb/d between 2023 and 2030 before starting to decline
as rising EV sales and fuel efficiency gains put pressure on refining margins. In the APS,
refinery runs drop by 15 mb/d by 2035, and some 30% of today’s refining capacity faces the
risk of lower utilisation or closure. In the NZE Scenario, this share rises to 50% by 2035.
The Middle East remains the largest crude oil exporter in all scenarios, and the share of its
exports flowing to emerging market and developing economies in Asia rises from 25% of total
seaborne crude trade today to 40% by 2050 in the STEPS. As a result, the Malacca Strait
between Malaysia and Indonesia becomes the world’s largest chokepoint for oil and gas
trade, with a higher volume of oil passing through it than the Strait of Hormuz, the
chokepoint in the Persian Gulf. China remains the world’s largest oil importer through to
2050 in the STEPS, and India and Southeast Asia see imports increase by around 35% by that
date. By 2050, crude oil import dependency in Asia rises from about 80% today to 90% in all
scenarios.

3.5.2

Natural gas

More than two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, global gas markets have regained a
fragile equilibrium. Natural gas exports from Russia have fallen from a pre-war record of
250 bcm in 2021 to 130 bcm in 2023. Natural gas demand in the European Union in 2023 was
20% below its level in 2021, and the United States was its second-largest supplier after
Norway, having delivered 60 bcm of LNG in 2023, or around half of its total LNG imports.
Global natural gas demand increased by 0.5% in 2023, with a 40 bcm contraction in advanced
economies, led by Europe, offset by 60 bcm of growth in emerging market and developing
economies, led by China and the Middle East. A wave of new supply is also on the horizon:
270 bcm of new LNG export terminals are under construction, and will add another 50% to
global LNG capacity, alongside an additional 200 bcm of annual production from upstream
projects sanctioned since early 2022 that target local markets.
Natural gas demand has been revised upward in all scenarios compared with the WEO-2023,
reflecting stronger anticipated demand for gas to meet growth in electricity demand in China
as well as additional demand in the Middle East, where policies to shift away from oil in
electricity generation have been reaffirmed. In the STEPS, the level of demand in 2030 has
been revised up by 130 bcm compared to the Outlook in 2023, reaching just over 4 400 bcm
before demand peaks.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Low-emissions gases – biogas, biomethane and hydrogen – are poised to see strong growth
in all scenarios. By 2050, they reach nearly 400 billion cubic metre equivalent (bcme) in the

60% of total gas demand in 2050.

Demand
In the STEPS, natural gas demand growth averages 0.5% per year in the 2023-2035 period,
compared with a 2% average annual rate in the 2010-2023 period. Demand reaches a
maximum level around 2030 and then declines very slightly through to 2050 (Figure 3.35).
This trajectory is largely a consequence of accelerating deployment of renewables, efficiency
gains and the electrification of end-uses. In the APS, demand begins to decline in the
second-half of the 2020s and is 17% lower by 2035 than it was in 2023. In the NZE Scenario,
demand falls by roughly 5% per year from 2023 to 2035, and by 6% per year on average
between 2035 and 2050.

After decades of growth, natural gas demand is set to plateau by 2030 under
current policy settings; demand falls 40% in the APS by 2050 and 80% in the NZE Scenario
Notes: bcm = billion cubic metres. Other includes LNG own use, transformation and distribution processes,
and other own uses.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Coal-to-gas switching in the power sector in the United States in recent years is largely a
consequence of cheap gas following the shale revolution, and has been responsible for over
120 bcm of natural gas demand growth between 2013 and 2022 (offset in part by 20 bcm of
switching from gas to renewables over the same period). Rapid advances in renewables and
efficiency gains in all scenarios leave little space for further coal-to-gas switching. However,
the increase that has already taken place, together with increases in the use of natural gas
in industry and own use in the LNG sector, means that the United States has been responsible
for 30% of global natural gas demand growth during this period, an amount similar to China.
Growth in electricity demand opens some space for natural gas use in the power sector in
emerging market and developing economies, where it increases by 190 bcm between 2023
and 2035 in the STEPS. However, this is more than offset by a reduction of 230 bcm in natural
gas use in the power sector in advanced economies over the same period. Industry is the
second-largest source of demand growth in emerging market and developing economies,
recording a 150 bcm gain over the same period: this is only slightly offset by a 5 bcm
contraction in natural gas use in industry in advanced economies. In the APS, natural gas
demand growth in emerging market and developing economies is significantly reduced by
faster deployment of renewables and more rapid efficiency gains across the board, together
with scaling up the use of low-emissions fuels in industry (Figure 3.36). (Sensitivity analysis
of the outlook for natural gas in the STEPS is included in Chapter 4 and the conditions under
which gas demand could continue to grow post-2030 are discussed in Chapter 1.)

Meeting current net zero emissions pledges would bring gas demand down more
sharply in advanced economies and limit the scope for growth in EMDE
Note: Developing Asia includes China, India, Southeast Asia and Other Asia.

Supply and trade
The STEPS sees a net increase of 200 bcm of gas production between 2023 and 2035, with
supply increases of around 500 bcm in markets with growing supply offsetting a drop of
around 300 bcm elsewhere (Figure 3.37).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Even though its production peaks around 2030, the United States maintains its position as
the world’s largest natural gas producing country through to 2050. The Middle East as a
whole – led by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran – sees the largest growth in supply in the STEPS:
its share of rises from 17% in 2023 to almost 30% in 2050. Russian gas production fails to
stage a meaningful recovery from a nadir in 2023. Sanctions exacerbate the difficulty to
diversify export outlets after the loss of the European market and the absence of a material
increase in domestic demand means that Russian gas production in 2035 remains around
20% below pre-Ukraine invasion levels. In the APS and NZE Scenario, export outlets dry up
further, and Russian gas production in 2035 falls to an average of 30-50% below pre-invasion
levels.
After years spent developing the Vaca Muerta shale formation, Argentina is poised to sharply
increase its natural gas production: it rises by 35 bcm in the STEPS to a level 80% higher than
current production by 2035. Gas production also rises modestly in Brazil, but it declines in
other countries in Central and South America in the STEPS, resulting in a 10 bcm net increase
for the region between 2023 and 2035. In the APS and NZE Scenario this net increase in gas
production in the region is erased by declining demand.

Natural gas production slows in most regions compared to the previous decade;
production in North America sees the largest relative change between scenarios
Note: C & S America = Central and South America.

Mature fields and slow upstream investment activity in North Africa bring overall natural gas
production down by 15 bcm by 2035 in the STEPS, which puts a strain on its ability to meet
domestic demand and export commitments concurrently. The story is different in
sub-Saharan Africa, where there are robust increases in production in emerging producers
such as Mauritania, Senegal and Mozambique, as well as in established producers such as
Nigeria. In aggregate, Africa increases production to 15% above 2023 levels in the STEPS by
2035. In the APS, this falls by 8% compared with 2023. Roughly 25% of total gas production
in 2035 is exported in both scenarios.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global natural gas trade increasingly pivots toward emerging markets in Asia. Most of the
increase comes in the form of LNG: the share of imports met by long-distance pipeline trade
falls from almost 50% in 2023 to 40% by 2035 in the STEPS, and falls further in APS and the
NZE Scenario. The largest growth market for gas imports is China, which imports an
additional 80 bcm in 2035 in the STEPS compared with today: 40% of this additional growth
is met by pipeline, and the remainder by LNG. India is the second-largest source of
incremental import demand.
Natural gas demand in the European Union falls to 260 bcm by 2035 – a third below levels
prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – and it falls more rapidly than domestic production,
meaning that imports drop from a peak of 370 bcm in 2021 to below 250 bcm by 2035 in the
STEPS. Japan’s gas imports fall by 40% between 2023 and 2035 as a consequence of nuclear
restarts and renewables growth. Korea’s gas imports fall by almost 10% over the same period
(Figure 3.38).

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has redrawn the map of global gas flows; the United States
solidifies its position as the largest exporter, while overall trade pivots toward emerging Asia

In the STEPS, LNG demand increases by more than 2.5% per year over the 2023-2035 period,
which is faster than overall natural gas demand but far less rapid than the average 6% per
year LNG growth rate between 2013 and 2022. Around 270 bcm of new LNG supply is
currently under construction, and this will lead to a near-doubling of capacity in the United
States and Qatar, which are set to dominate supply in 2035, together accounting for around
50% of global LNG trade in the STEPS by this date. This increased supply concentration is
likely to put a spotlight on possible security of supply risks that might arise from extreme
weather in the Gulf of Mexico and from disruption in the Middle East.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Due to an upward adjustment to projected natural gas demand growth to 2030, LNG demand
growth in the STEPS is higher than in the WEO-2023, reaching more than 700 bcm by 2035.
However, this pace of growth does not keep pace with export capacity additions. As a result,
a 130 bcm surplus emerges by 2030, bringing prices down in key importing regions like the
European Union, China and Japan to a range between USD 6.5- 8.5 per million British thermal
units (MBtu). This makes it difficult for some exporters to fully recover their long-run
marginal cost of supply during this period.
This LNG surplus narrows in subsequent years as LNG demand growth continues in the 2030s,
and a supply gap emerges in 2040. By 2050, around 175 bcm of additional LNG export
capacity is required in the STEPS to cover both demand growth and retiring capacity. This
additional supply mainly comes from the Middle East, East Africa and North America. In the
APS, projects currently under construction are sufficient to meet LNG demand: this peaks at
650 bcm in 2030, and no supply gap emerges. In the NZE Scenario, demand can be met in
aggregate from projects existing today, without any need for additional LNG from projects
148

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

currently under construction: this has a profound effect on gas prices in importing regions,
which fall to around USD 5/MBtu by 2030.
Russia does not manage to replace the gas export volumes lost to Europe. Given ample
supply in China to meet demand in all scenarios, we do not assume that the Power of
Siberia 2 pipeline comes online. As a result, Russia’s exports to China reach a maximum level
of 60 bcm per year in the STEPS through to 2050. With sanctions compounding the difficulty
of increasing LNG export capacity, Russian LNG production peaks at just under 50 bcm in
2030, which is far below the government target level of 150 bcm by 2030.

Global coal demand has been volatile in recent years. It dropped sharply during the Covid-19
pandemic, but it rebounded during the subsequent recovery, increased further after the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, and rose to a record high in 2023 on the back of strong growth
in China and India.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Demand
Coal demand is projected to fall in the years ahead in all scenarios, but the timing and the
speed of its decline is closely tied to the strength of climate action. In the STEPS, demand
drops by around 25% by 2035 from 2023 levels, with rapid reductions in advanced economies
and modest declines in emerging market and developing economies. The fall in consumption
Chapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

149

3

after 2035 is more widespread, with coal use about 45% lower in 2050 than in 2023. In the
APS, demand falls more quickly: it is already about 45% lower than in 2023 by 2035, and 75%
lower by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, global demand plunges by around 70% by 2035 and over
90% by 2050.
China remains the largest consumer of coal, accounting for over half of global coal demand
in 2035 in each scenario, but surging growth in renewables and slowly declining demand in
industry lead coal use in China to fall over the next few years. India is the second-largest coal
consumer and is the main driver of future demand growth: its coal use increases in power to
2030 and in industry to 2050 in the STEPS, and its energy-related CO2 emissions continue to
rise before peaking around 2035. Demand increases steadily in a number of countries in
Southeast Asia. Almost everywhere else, however, the STEPS sees coal demand head
downwards.
Advanced economies have historically consumed more coal per capita than emerging market
and developing economies, but this has changed in recent years as they have retired coal
plants or run them less frequently, while many emerging market and developing economies
have installed new plants and used coal to meet rising energy needs. In 2023, 26 GW of coalfired generation capacity were retired globally, 88% of them in advanced economies, while
65 GW were added, almost all in emerging market and developing economies: China
accounted for 47 GW (73%) of these global capacity additions.
The power sector currently accounts for 65% of world coal demand, and it continues to be
the largest coal user in the STEPS and APS through to 2050. In the NZE Scenario, however,
the speed at which renewables and energy efficiency progress in the power sector means
that the industry sector overtakes it as the largest coal user by 2035. In this scenario, there
is a risk that recently commissioned coal assets fail to recover their investment. By 2050, coal
use in the NZE Scenario drops to below 10% of today’s level, and over 75% of its emissions
are captured with the use of CCUS.

Supply and trade

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global coal production reached a new record in 2023, driven by growth in China, India and
Indonesia. Over 30 new mines opened, 25 in China and four in India (Global Energy
Monitor, 2024). China accounted for around 55% of global coal supply. India nearly overtook
Indonesia as the second-largest coal producer following two years of record increases in
production, and it plans to double coal output by 2030. Despite raising production, China
continued to increase coal imports in 2023, while Indonesia and Mongolia raised exports.
In the STEPS, coal production peaks around 2025 and then falls by nearly 30% to 2035,
dropping by 50% in advanced economies and 25% in emerging market and developing
economies. It then continues to fall through to 2050. The supply of steam coal, mainly used
in the power sector along with lignite, drops by close to 55% to 2050; the production of
coking coal, mostly used in steel production, falls by about 25%. In the APS, global production
falls by around 50% to 2035 and by nearly 80% to 2050. China, in line with its pledge that its
total CO2 emissions will peak before 2030, accounts for most of this decrease, reducing its
150

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

production by over 1 600 Mtce by 2035 and nearly 2 800 Mtce by 2050; this reduction is
larger than that of all other economies combined. In the NZE Scenario, global coal supply
declines by around 70% to 2035 and by over 90% to 2050 (Figure 3.39).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global coal exports approached historical records in 2023, driven mainly by increased activity
in the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for 80% of total imports. Indonesia and Australia
were responsible for over half of global exports in 2023, with Indonesia solidifying its position
as the largest exporting country. Australia provides 45% of global coking coal exports, and
Indonesia around 40% of steam coal exports. China is the largest single importing country: it
draws in around 30% of the global total, and these imports meet 10% of its domestic
demand. India, Japan and Korea together account for roughly a further 35% of global
imports.
In the STEPS, coal trade falls around 25% by 2035 and 40% by 2050 as China’s market shrinks
and India increases domestic production. Demand for high quality steam coal in advanced
economies faces a tighter market as Russia’s exports diminish. In the APS, coal use falls faster,
causing trade to drop by around 45% to 2035 and nearly 75% to 2050. India overtakes China
as the largest single importer of coal before 2030, while Indonesia and Australia remain the
major exporters, and imports of coking coal to Europe, Japan and other advanced economies
decline to around one-fifth of 2023 levels by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, the transition away
from coal is fast, and trade falls to just under 10% of 2023 levels by 2050.

Investment
Coal prices surged amid supply shortages in 2021 and were followed by even higher prices in
2022, leading major coal consumers like China and India to scale up investment in domestic
production. This led to an increase of over 5% in investment in global coal supply in 2023
(Figure 3.40). Emerging market and developing economies accounted for around 90% of all
coal investment in 2023, with China being by far the largest single coal investor across all
sectors. Investment in advanced economies has been slowly dwindling and continues to fall
in all scenarios, with the highest absolute decrease to 2050 taking place in Australia.

Investment in coal supply and coal-fired generation totalled some USD 195 billion in 2023.
Investment in the STEPS responds to falling demand by dropping to 60% below its 2023 level
by 2035 and 80% below it by 2050. Around 60% of this remaining investment is concentrated
in China, India and Southeast Asia. In the APS, investment falls by around 75% by 2035 and
85% by 2050. In the NZE Scenario, investment falls to less than 5% of 2023 levels by 2050 and
is mostly geared to supply facilities equipped with CCUS.

Modern bioenergy

Global bioenergy consumption was around 60 EJ in 2023. The use of biomass such as wood,
charcoal and other solid bioenergy in traditional cooking stoves accounted for about
one-third and modern bioenergy for the remainder. In the industry sector, modern solid
biomass is mainly used where process residues are available, such as food or paper
production. It can also be employed in the power sector as a dispatchable source of
renewable electricity, or in improved cookstoves to replace the traditional use of solid
biomass. Transport biofuels, primarily ethanol and biodiesel, can be used across different
152

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

transport modes but can have long-term advantages in areas where electrification is
challenging, such as shipping and aviation. Biogas is used as a local source of dispatchable
heat and power, or when upgraded, can be converted to biomethane for use as a drop-in
replacement for natural gas.
Modern bioenergy is versatile, but its sustainability credentials have come under scrutiny.
Currently, around 20% of its supply comes from cropland dedicated to conventional biofuel
production, and therefore is potentially competing with food production. The remaining 80%
of supply is from organic waste streams, and forest and wood residues. Questions have been
raised about this type of feedstock development on the grounds that it can have negative
effects on biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions. Clear sustainability criteria and tools
such as life cycle greenhouse gas performance standards are essential to ensure that the
future development of bioenergy resources commands widespread public acceptance.
Modern bioenergy demand worldwide increases from 42 EJ today to 56 EJ by 2035 and to
more than 70 EJ by 2050 in the STEPS (Figure 3.41). In the APS and NZE Scenario, production
rises to almost 100 EJ by 2050, with the majority of feedstocks derived from sustainable
sources such as forestry and agricultural residues, recycled organic material and other
organic waste streams. The shift to these feedstocks is driven by regulations that
differentiate feedstocks based on their life cycle emissions and provide enhanced financial
support to projects with relatively low-emissions intensities.

Modern solid bioenergy
Solid bioenergy accounts for around 85% of total modern bioenergy demand. This share
declines in all scenarios to around three-quarters by 2050. In the STEPS, modern solid
bioenergy demand reaches 45 EJ by 2035 and 55 EJ by 2050, with notable demand growth
from the power sector in China and industry in India. The APS and NZE Scenario both project
higher growth, to 75 EJ by 2050. The use of solid biomass for power generation is the single
largest source of demand for bioenergy in these two scenarios. This is primarily the result of
a large requirement for dispatchable power in a world in which electricity accounts for
around half of total final consumption. The largest source of growth is the power sector in
China, where consumption grows from 3 EJ today to 7 EJ in 2050 in the APS.

Liquid biofuels
Demand for liquid biofuels rose by around 7% in 2023 to reach 2.3 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day (mboe/d). In the STEPS, demand increases to 3.2 mboe/d in 2035 and to
4.1 mboe/d in 2050, mainly due to an increase in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demand
from almost zero today to over 0.8 mboe/d. In the APS, liquid biofuels rise to 6.3 mboe/d by
2035 and 7 mboe/d by 2050, with over half of the increase above the level in the STEPS from
the scaling up of SAF and most of the rest from increased biodiesel demand. In the
NZE Scenario, the use of liquid biofuels expands more rapidly than in the other scenarios,
reaching 6.5 mboe/d by the early 2030s, with SAF making up around 20% of total demand.
Demand plateaus in the NZE Scenario after 2035 and is below APS levels by 2040 as
electrification takes over many end-uses faster and more thoroughly than in the APS.
In the STEPS, liquid biofuel demand expands by around three-quarters between 2023 and
2035 in emerging market and developing economies but falls by 10% in advanced economies.
By 2050, Brazil, Indonesia and India, which are each able to leverage a wide pool of potential
feedstocks, together account for half of liquid biofuel demand, compared with 30% today. In
the APS, growth is more evenly distributed as countries with net zero emissions pledges use
a wide range of feedstocks to develop their bioenergy resources: by 2050, demand for liquid
bioenergy rises by 40% in advanced economies and more than triples in emerging market
and developing economies. In the NZE Scenario, demand more than doubles in emerging
market and developing economies by 2050.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Biogas and biomethane
In the STEPS, combined biogas and biomethane demand more than doubles by 2035 to reach
90 bcme. In all scenarios, the share of biomethane in total biogases demand increases by
2050, driven largely by the value attached to its use as a dispatchable source of energy and
as a drop-in substitute for natural gas. The cost gap between natural gas and biomethane
currently averages around USD 10/MBtu in key gas-consuming regions, but this narrows to
USD 4/MBtu in the APS reflecting CO2 pricing, policy support and economies of scale. In the
STEPS, advanced economies see their share of total global demand decline from about 50%
today to just 21% in 2050. Demand in China meanwhile rises considerably, reaching nearly
100 bcme by 2050 and accounting for 40% of global demand. In the APS and NZE Scenario,
154

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

total biomethane demand amounts to around 220 bcme by 2050, compared with about
150 bcme in the STEPS.

3.6

Key clean energy technologies

Clean energy is experiencing rapid growth as deployment of several key technologies
accelerates on the foundation of policy support and sustained cost reductions. Since 2019,
clean energy growth has outpaced that of fossil fuels by a ratio of two-to-one. The production
of low-emissions electricity has expanded by almost 2 000 TWh, around 20%, despite
disruption in hydropower from droughts and unscheduled downtime at some nuclear power
plants. In contrast, fossil fuel-based electricity generation increased by 910 TWh, around 5%,
which is less than the growth of solar PV alone – 930 TWh since 2019 – and on a par with the
increase in wind power output. Global investment in clean energy over this period rose by
almost 50%, about 10% per year on average, and is set to reach almost USD 2 trillion in 2024.
However, investment needs to increase to approximately USD 4.5 trillion per year by 2030
to deliver what is required in the NZE Scenario, and clean energy deployment needs to
broaden: at present it is heavily concentrated in advanced economies and China (IEA, 2024a).

Note: Other includes energy efficiency improvements, other fuel switching such as electrification or switching

The momentum behind clean energy technologies is shifting the outlook for emissions even
under current policy settings. In the STEPS, CO2 emissions are projected to be 6.5 Gt lower in
2030 than in our 2015 pre-Paris Baseline Scenario (Figure 3.42). In the APS, the deployment
of seven key clean energy technologies – solar PV, wind power, nuclear, electric vehicles,
heat pumps, low-emissions hydrogen and carbon capture – accounts for about threeChapter 3 | Pathways for the energy mix

155

quarters of energy-related CO2 emissions reductions between 2023 and 2035 and beyond.
Scaling up of these technologies is also the main enabling factor for the decline in fossil fuel
demand this decade in the NZE Scenario.

3.6.1

Solar PV

Solar PV capacity additions increased by over 80% in 2023 to reach a new record of 425 GW.
Solar PV deployment increased 2.5-times in China, which was responsible for over 60% of all
capacity additions. Rapid expansion of manufacturing in China resulted in a 50% reduction in
PV module costs since December 2022, which improved the competitiveness of solar PV and
boosted its uptake. Advanced economies accounted for most of the remaining growth in
2023, with capacity additions of nearly 60 GW in the European Union and over 30 GW in the
United States. In the rest of the world, solar PV capacity additions in 2023 were over 70 GW.
Solar PV capacity additions expand by almost 60% in the STEPS by 2035, double in the APS
and increase 2.5-fold in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.43). Today, solar PV generates just over
5% of total electricity generation, but it is set to increase its share to 17% in 2030, and thus
to play a crucial role in helping to meet the COP28 pledge of tripling renewable capacity by
2030. By 2035, solar PV overtakes coal-fired and gas-fired generation to become the main
source of electricity, providing 25% of total generation in the STEPS, 30% in the APS and 35%
in the NZE Scenario. The rapid rise of solar PV increases the need for power system flexibility
to ensure electricity security (see Chapter 5).

3.6.2

Wind

Worldwide wind power capacity additions increased over 50% to 116 GW in 2023, surpassing
the previous record high in 2020 (Figure 3.44). Onshore wind projects accounted for 107 GW
of the additions, 92% of the total. By far, China increased capacity more than any other
country, adding 76 GW of wind capacity, 66% of the total. Expansion in advanced economies
was much lower, with only 15 GW of wind capacity additions in the European Union, on a
par with 2022, and just above 6 GW in the United States, down from over 14 GW in 2020 and
2021. However, capacity additions in the United States and the European Union are
projected to increase significantly in the coming years in part reflecting the long-term policy
support provided by the US Inflation Reduction Act and to recent European Union policies to
address the challenges posed by slow and complex permitting procedures. Issues such as the
cost of financing, revenue uncertainty and delays in grid connections continue to constrain
more rapid deployment, especially in emerging market and developing economies other
than China.

Global wind capacity additions were up more than 50% in 2023,
passing the 2020 high, and accelerate further in all scenarios

With 1 000 GW of installed capacity generating over 2 300 TWh, wind power is the largest
source of variable renewable electricity today. Over 60 countries have set deployment
targets for wind as part of their climate pledges. It has a central role in efforts to fulfil the
COP28 pledge of tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Wind capacity additions increase in all
scenarios. Wind becomes the second-largest source of electricity by capacity in the STEPS by
2035, passing 2 800 GW of installed capacity and 7 500 TWh of generation. More rapid
electrification and accelerated low-emissions power deployment see these numbers
increase even faster with installed wind capacity rising to over 3 500 GW in the APS and over
4 500 GW in the NZE Scenario by 2035.

3.6.3

Nuclear

In countries open to the technology, nuclear power can be an important source of lowemissions electricity. It currently provides 9% of global electricity. It can offer baseload power,
enhance grid stability and flexibility, and optimise grid capacity utilisation, making it a
valuable part of a portfolio of low-emissions technologies designed to achieve net zero
emissions by 2050.
In 2023, five new nuclear reactors with a combined capacity of 5.5 GW began operations in
Belarus, China, Korea, Slovak Republic and United States. Combined with the 1.6 GW of
existing reactors that were restarted after suspended operations, this more than offset the
6.3 GW of nuclear capacity retirements in 2023, resulting in a net increase of operational
nuclear capacity. Through the first nine months of 2024, 4.5 GW of new nuclear capacity has
been connected to the grid from new nuclear reactors in China, India, United Arab Emirates
and United States. Over the same period, construction started on seven other reactors: five
in China, and one each in Egypt and Russia. As of October 2024, there were 62 reactors with
around 75 GW of capacity under construction, which would increase worldwide nuclear
capacity by nearly 20% when connected to electricity systems.

Nuclear capacity additions accelerate in all scenarios, with China accounting

Nuclear capacity and generation are set to increase in each scenario, albeit at a slower pace
than several other low-emissions power technologies (Figure 3.45). Emerging market and
developing economies drive this growth, notably China, which accounts for 40% of global
nuclear capacity additions in the STEPS by 2035 and almost 50% in the NZE Scenario. These
158

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

projected additions mean that China is on track to have the largest nuclear power capacity
in the world by around 2030 in each scenario.
Small modular reactors are under development in several advanced economies, including
Canada, France, Japan, Korea, United Kingdom and United States. China and Russia are also
developing them. If they can be brought successfully to market at reasonable costs, they
could provide new opportunities for nuclear power in more markets around the world.

3.6.4

Electric vehicles

While electric cars currently account for around 20% of new car sales, they represent less
than 5% of the total number of cars on the road. Tight margins, high inflation, the phase-out
of purchase incentives in some countries, and a lack of public charging infrastructure have
raised questions about how fast EV uptake can be increased. However, global sales data
remain robust. In 2023, global electric car sales, including battery electric and plug-in hybrids,
reached about 14 million units. Sales are expected to grow this year to around 17 million,
representing more than one-in-five cars sold. In the first-half of 2024, electric car sales
increased by around 25% compared to the same period in 2023, driven largely by strong
performance in China, which accounted for 60% of global sales. In August 2024 alone, electric
car sales in China exceeded 1 million, and sales in 2024 as a whole are set to exceed 10 million.
By the end of 2024, EVs are expected to account for nearly half of all cars sold in China.

159

In the STEPS, the share of electric car sales rises to over 55% by 2035 (Figure 3.46). Key drivers
of this growth include the rapid expansion of the Chinese EV market, newly implemented
EPA regulations in the United States, CO2 emissions standards in the European Union, and
the launch of new EV models in markets such as India, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Continued reductions in battery costs also play a part, with global average battery cell prices
to drop below USD 80/kWh during the first nine months of 2024, sustaining the optimism
(Benchmark Minerals, 2024).
Significant investment over the past five years has led to battery manufacturing capacity far
exceeding current demand. In 2023, global EV battery manufacturing capacity was around
2.2 TWh, while demand was approximately 750 gigawatt-hours (GWh). Yet, the current
excess capacity may not last very long: battery demand is set to rise very quickly, increasing
more than fourfold by 2030 in the STEPS, fivefold in the APS and sevenfold in the
NZE Scenario. However, manufacturing capacity appears capable of keeping pace:
committed and existing battery manufacturing capacities together are close to what is
needed by 2030 in the NZE Scenario.
Electric cars are becoming more affordable as competition intensifies, especially in China.
Around 60% of electric cars sold in China today are cheaper than their average internal
combustion engine (ICE) equivalent, but electric cars generally remain more expensive than
their ICE equivalents in Europe and the United States, though much depends on the
particular country and car segment (IEA, 2024f). Mass market adoption of EVs requires the
introduction of more affordable models to the market. Many automakers plan to launch
cheaper electric models in Europe and the United States. Declining battery prices should also
improve affordability.

3.6.5

Heat pumps

Heat pumps today account for 12% of sales of residential heating equipment worldwide.
They have already overtaken sales of fossil fuel-based heating systems in some markets such
as France and the United States. By 2035, their market share is set to almost double in the
STEPS, reaching approximately 30% in the APS and 40% in the NZE Scenario (Figure 3.47).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

However, in 2023 global heat pump sales marked a 3% decline, a shift after two consecutive
years of double-digit growth driven by the energy crisis. Sales rose by 12% in China, but it
was the only major market to buck the trend. Several factors, with varying regional impact,
contributed to the global slowdown, including a decrease in natural gas prices from their
2022 peaks, policy and subsidy changes, less new building construction, and broad consumer
aversion to large ticket items amid high interest rates and inflation. The decline in heat pump
sales in 2023 also reflects a broader downturn in heating equipment sales in some regions.
Wide deployment of heat pumps in a variety of applications can help meet climate targets.
Despite the slight decline in sales in 2023, there are reasons to expect a pick-up in the years
to come. Heat pumps are becoming increasingly competitive with gas boilers in key markets
over their lifetimes. When considering both cooling and heating, heat pumps already
160

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

represent one of the most cost-effective options, even in markets where natural gas prices
are relatively low, such as the United States. Additionally, there are numerous recent
investment announcements and upcoming funding support measures, such as the Inflation
Reduction Act in the United States, which aim to develop local manufacturing capabilities
and to lower costs.
Despite the progress being made and the projections of rising sales, upfront costs often
remain high, particularly for low-income and middle-income households, and the design of
electricity tariffs and energy taxes still disadvantages heat pumps compared to fossil fuel
boilers in some countries. Maintaining policy stability and heat pump subsidies over the long
term, and reforming electricity and gas tariffs in the context of declining gas prices will be
critical to provide market actors with visibility while sustaining the rapid manufacturing
capacity expansions seen in recent years. Growing sales are going to require more and more
skilled installers, which is another issue for governments to consider.

Global hydrogen production reached 97 Mt in 2023, an increase of almost 2.5% compared to

for a further 16%. Low-emissions hydrogen production in 2023 was below 1 million tonnes
hydrogen (Mt H2) and was primarily derived from fossil fuels with CCUS technologies;
production from water electrolysis was below 100 thousand tonnes hydrogen (kt H2) and it
is primarily located in China.

Low-emissions hydrogen production increases rapidly in the APS, more than tripling from

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In 2023, worldwide installed capacity of water electrolysers for dedicated hydrogen
production reached 1.4 GW, and the capacity added in 2023 nearly matched the cumulative
global installed capacity up to 2022. China, which accounted for less than 10% of the global
installed capacity in 2020, was responsible for more than four-fifths of the capacity that came
online in 2023, including the world's largest electrolyser project, the 260 MW Kuqa plant by
Sinopec. Projected low-emissions hydrogen production from announced projects could
reach 49 Mt H2 by 2030. Excluding those in very early stages of development, production
could exceed 26 Mt H2 by 2030 and could meet what is required in the APS in 2030 for lowemissions hydrogen production. However, this 26 Mt H2 would represent only 40% of the
total low-emissions hydrogen production needed in the NZE Scenario in 2030. If projects at
early stages are included, the 49 Mt H2 by 2030 represent three-quarters of projected needs
in the NZE scenario. The largest part of the remaining gap in this scenario consists of lowemissions hydrogen produced from electrolysis, while production from fossil fuels with CCUS
is already closer to the projected value in the NZE Scenario.
By 2050, low-emissions hydrogen production in the APS accounts for 82% of global hydrogen
production, thanks to its use in heavy industry, transport, production of hydrogen-based
fuels and electricity generation. In the NZE Scenario, low-emissions hydrogen production
162

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

accounts for 70% of all hydrogen production by 2035, which rises to more than 95% by 2050.
Low-emissions hydrogen produced from fossil fuels with CCUS technologies accounts for
over 20% of total hydrogen production both in the APS and in the NZE Scenario by 2050,
capturing over 585 Mt CO2 in the APS and around 615 Mt CO2 in the NZE Scenario. Global
electrolyser production accounts for 65% of total hydrogen production in the APS and almost
80% in the NZE Scenario by 2050, requiring the installation of 2 000 GW of electrolyser
capacity in the APS and 3 000 GW in the NZE Scenario.
Renewable energy capacity will need to increase significantly to meet electricity demand that
arises from low-emissions hydrogen production. By 2050, the installed capacity of
renewables for hydrogen production reaches 3 000 GW in the APS and nearly 5 000 GW in
the NZE Scenario, with almost 80% of this capacity coming from solar PV. The dedicated
renewables generation for hydrogen production accounts for more than 10% of global
electricity generation in APS by 2050 and 15% in NZE. Global hydrogen and hydrogen-based
fuel trade increases in 2050 to almost 60 million tonnes of hydrogen equivalent (Mt H2-eq)
in the APS and almost 75 Mt H2-eq in the NZE Scenario, representing around 20% of overall
low-emissions hydrogen demand in both scenarios. This requires the development of
extensive infrastructure for the storage and transport of both hydrogen and ammonia, even
though some elements of the existing infrastructure for fossil fuels could be utilised.

Carbon capture, utilisation and storage

Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) is currently applied at around 45 facilities
worldwide with a capture capacity of roughly 50 Mt CO2 per year. While expansion of
operational capacity has been slow in recent years, announced projects indicate potential
strong growth on the horizon. Realisation of all the projects announced worldwide, which
could be completed by 2030, would total 435 Mt CO2 of capture capacity and around
615 Mt CO2 of storage capacity per year. However, this is far from assured as only 20% of the
announced capture capacity and 15% of the announced storage capacity have reached a final
investment decision or are already in operation (IEA, 2024g).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

For the next decade, the list of announced projects falls short of what is needed to capture
1.3 Gt CO2 globally by 2035 in line with the APS, and still further below the 2.5 Gt CO2
required in the NZE (Figure 3.49). To get closer to NDC and net zero emissions targets, new
projects are needed to reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants and in hard-toabate industrial processes. In both the APS and NZE Scenario, CCUS technology is also
employed to produce low-emissions hydrogen from natural gas, accounting for 10-15% of
total emissions captured annually by 2050. The use of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal
increases especially in the NZE Scenario, to reach 1.2 Gt CO2 by 2050, or a fifth of all captured
emissions.
In the power sector, carbon capture technologies offer the ability to significantly reduce
CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants, which emitted 11.3 Gt CO2 in 2023, or almost
30% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. With around 9 000 coal-fired units in operation

today, many of which have potentially long lifetimes ahead, CCUS could have a role to reduce
their emissions to keep climate targets within reach. In the STEPS, carbon capture in the
power sector makes limited progress since few projects have reached the stage of final
investment decision, and there are few concrete policy targets. In the APS and NZE Scenario,
however, carbon capture expands rapidly to 2035 and beyond, to reach around 1 050 Mt CO2
in the APS and 1 300 Mt CO2 in the NZE Scenario by 2050. This supports the emissions
reductions for coal plants achieved in these scenarios, along with repurposing them for
flexibility, retrofitting them to use low-emissions ammonia or retiring them early (IEA, 2022).

years, but it could play a major role to cut emissions in the power and industry sectors

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: DAC = direct air capture; Mt CO2 = million tonnes of carbon dioxide.

In the industry sector, there is currently a large gap between project announcements and the
required rates of emissions capture in the APS by 2035. About 4.5 Mt of capture capacity
operates in industry today, and a further 39 Mt of planned capacity has progressed to the
feasibility study stage or beyond. However, even if all planned capacity were realised, it
would fall well short of the 330 Mt CO2/year captured in the APS by 2035, half of which the
APS projects to be deployed in the cement sub-sector, and much of the rest from the
production of chemicals and steel. Due to project announcements and policies such as the
US Inflation Reduction Act, the Canadian CCUS Investment Tax Credit, and the EU Emissions
Trading System, two-thirds of the deployment in 2030 in the APS is in advanced economies.
These innovative projects and supporting policies demonstrate the feasibility and improve
the competitiveness of carbon capture technologies. Beyond 2030, however, two-thirds of
CCUS deployment in the industry sector by 2035 is projected to be in emerging market and
developing economies, where energy-intensive industries are concentrated.

Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook
Considering potential variations from the STEPS
S U M M A R Y
• While the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) provides the direction of travel for the
energy system based on today’s policy settings, a wide range of factors influence the
energy sector and there are many uncertainties. In this chapter we explore the
possible impact of several uncertainties on the outlook in the STEPS.

• We do this by analysing the issues and building sensitivity cases around some of the
most important and topical uncertainties affecting the energy sector. This includes
how variations in the pace of growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and in the use of plugin hybrids might impact energy demand. We also consider variations in the assumed
pace of renewables deployment and assess potential responses to liquefied natural
gas oversupply. And we consider uncertainties about how the development of data
centres and artificial intelligence, the pace of appliance efficiency improvements, and
more frequent and intense heat waves might affect electricity demand.

• Oil demand could be 2-3% higher or lower in 2035 than in the STEPS in the sensitivity
cases. EV sales were the largest uncertainty analysed: a slower uptake of EVs could
raise oil demand by 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2030, mainly in the United
States and Europe, and by more than 2 mb/d by 2035. By contrast, enhanced
utilisation of EV manufacturing capacity could lead to more EVs being sold in emerging
market and developing economies outside China, reducing oil demand by 1.8 mb/d in
2035.

• Natural gas demand could be affected by a liquefied natural gas surplus of around
130 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2030 in the STEPS. Fully absorbed, this would lift
global gas demand by up to 3% in 2035. The gas could help accelerate coal-to-gas
switching in industry, but it could also delay the deployment of wind power and heat
pumps. Conversely, natural gas demand could be 4% lower in 2035 from slower
electricity demand growth and faster solar PV uptake.

• Electricity demand could move up or down in our sensitivity cases by up to 1 700 TWh
to 2035, or about 5%. In the high case, natural gas- and coal-fired power would adjust
up or down as needed in the near term, while renewables would play a bigger role
after 2030. In the low case, electricity demand would still rise rapidly.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Our analysis indicates that, even combining all the high cases, global peaks for oil,
natural gas and coal demand would still occur within a few years of those for STEPS,
albeit at higher absolute levels: up 1.7 mb/d for oil, 140 bcm for natural gas, and
37 million tonnes of coal equivalent for coal. Taking all the uncertainties together, CO2
emissions could be up to 1.0% higher than in the STEPS in 2035, or as much as 3.6%
lower, and in all cases would peak within a few years of the STEPS.

Introduction

The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) is based on analysis of current policy settings and
regulations. It aims to provide an understanding of where prevailing regional and global
energy trends are leading us. However, the energy sector is influenced by a wide range of
factors that make for uncertainty, as discussed in Chapter 2. These factors range from
shifting geopolitics to changing policies and customer behaviour, and from fast-evolving
climate impacts to changing markets and new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI).
In this chapter we explore several key uncertainties, using a set of sensitivity cases to
investigate how outputs could diverge from the STEPS trajectory. We focus our analysis of
uncertainties on the STEPS because it is the scenario which provides a sense of the prevailing
direction of travel for the energy sector. The sensitivity cases do not change the broad policy
backdrop that underpins and drives the STEPS, or the economic and demographic
assumptions that are reflected in the STEPS. Rather, they assess how varying some of the
assumptions about deployment rates in the STEPS might affect the energy demand outlook
by fuel, sector and region, focusing in particular on electric vehicles (EVs), renewables
deployment, the liquefied natural gas (LNG) surplus and electricity demand.
Each uncertainty is explored through the framework of the Global Energy and Climate (GEC)
Model, which allows us to quantify impacts, and to combine different impacts to provide a
better understanding of a plausible range of outcomes for demand by energy source, type
and associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. When carrying this out, we consider the
implications of each uncertainty for all fuels, including coal and renewables, as well as for
CO2 emissions. We focus on their direct impacts and avoid making assumptions about
consequential synergistic or counterbalancing effects in other areas of services demand. To
isolate the impact of the factors analysed, we have assumed for our sensitivity cases that the
price environment is consistent with the trajectories in the STEPS.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There are many uncertainties that bear on the energy outlook. Those we have selected are
all important in terms of their potential impacts and are currently the subject of much
debate. We have chosen not to look at the impacts of specific geopolitical events or changes
to trade patterns that could occur, or to make assumptions about specific policy changes,
but rather to focus on potential shifts in deployment rates, whatever the cause, with the aim
of shedding light on the direction and scale of the impacts they might have.

Exploring the uncertainties

All aspects of energy are subject to a wide range of uncertainties, and so are our scenarios.
The uncertainties we explore in detail in this chapter are by no means comprehensive, but
they are all important and topical. A central goal of sensitivity analysis is to explore the
possible impact of changes to modelling results. The analysis presented in this chapter is
intended to provide insight into what those impacts might be, and thus to help improve
understanding of the energy system. We focus on four main areas: EVs, renewables
deployment, the LNG surplus and electricity demand.

Electric vehicles
The electric vehicle (EV) market is expanding rapidly, leading to a move away from oil to
electricity in road transport. Growth has been especially rapid in recent years: EV sales more
than tripled between 2018 and 2023, with China alone accounting for over half of the
increase. However, there are uncertainties about the future pace of growth in the EV market.
In the STEPS, our projections of EV trends and sales take account of factors such as consumer
response, advances in technology and policy support. The sensitivity cases consider some of
the uncertainties that could affect these parameters.
Our EV category includes plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which have a powertrain
that enables use of two energy sources, and we consider the impact of variations in that
usage.

Renewables deployment
Renewables account for a growing proportion of electricity generation, and their deployment
is set to continue to increase rapidly. Growth is driven primarily by wind and solar
photovoltaics (PV), which together increased by 16% year-on-year in 2023, with over half of
that expansion taking place in China. The rapid pace of renewables growth brings both risks
and opportunities. Risks could arise from pressures in supply chains or difficulties in
permitting, notably for wind; opportunities could arise from further large reductions in costs
of the kind that have benefited solar PV in the past, which could lead to an acceleration of
renewables deployment.
In addition, developments such as a switch from oil to gas in power generation in the Middle
East, for example, could have knock-on implications for the renewables sector.

LNG supply

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

A wave of new LNG export capacity is under construction, which has the potential to create
a surplus of supply in global gas markets. Downside pressure on natural gas prices could arise
from the additional supply, which could make LNG use more attractive for industry,
incentivising coal-to-gas switching.

168

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Lower natural gas prices also reduce the attractiveness to consumers for switching from gas
boilers to heat pumps, which could potentially delay the uptake of this more efficient form
of heating.

Electricity demand
The growth in demand for electricity use in data centres and artificial intelligence (AI) has
garnered a lot of attention recently. Growth will no doubt continue, but there are
uncertainties over its pace, which will be influenced by factors such as market trends,
algorithm developments and improvements in the efficiency of hardware and software.
Appliances and air conditioners account for a rising proportion of demand in emerging
market and developing economies, with increasing levels of ownership reflecting economic
growth and a rapidly expanding stock of buildings. This is exemplified by the 5% growth in
energy demand for appliances in 2023, with more than half of this growth in China.
Appliances tend to be less efficient in emerging market and developing economies than in
advanced economies, reflecting in part a strong second-hand market and more limited
energy efficiency measures. The pace at which the efficiency of appliances improves and the
extent to which levels of ownership increase together represent a significant uncertainty in
electricity demand projections.
Climate change is already leading to an increasing number of extreme weather events. This
includes heat waves which increase electricity demand in the short term by driving up
immediate cooling needs and in the longer term by pushing up the level of ownership of air
conditioners. The extent to which heat waves occur in the years ahead and the way that
responses to them affect electricity demand is another uncertainty.

Uncertainties impact multiple energy sources
Each uncertainty has an impact across more than one fuel type, reflecting the interconnected
nature of the energy system.
Most of the uncertainties we explore touch on the generation and/or demand of electricity.
A variety of fuels contribute to power generation, and changes that affect one of these fuels
have implications for others in the mix. For example, while EVs displace demand for oil, they
also increase demand for electricity which could be generated using coal, natural gas, oil or
a renewable energy source: the specific mix depends on location and timing.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Some of the uncertainties explored do not directly impact electricity demand, but they still
have implications for multiple primary energy sources. For example, changes from using coal
to natural gas in industry, or from using oil to natural gas for power generation in the Middle
East. Here again much depends on location and timing.

Our oil and gas sensitivity analysis suggest potential variations could alter total demand for
oil by as much as 3%, and gas by as much as 4% by 2035 relative to the STEPS (Figure 4.1).
Variations in electricity demand for our selected sensitivity elements reach almost 5% in 2035
compared to the STEPS, with related impacts on coal that reach 5% of total demand in 2030
before diminishing.
Combining all the sensitivity components and interactions into high and low cases indicates
that CO2 emissions peak within a few years of the STEPS (Figure 4.2). In the high case,
emissions are 1.6% higher in 2030 and 1% higher in 2035 than in the STEPS. In the low case,
emissions are down 1.6% in 2030 and 3.6% in 2035. These variations add up to 5 gigatonnes
(Gt) to cumulative energy sector emissions over the period to 2035, or reduce them by as
much as 7 Gt. Across our sensitivity analysis, overall CO2 emissions are affected less than the
demand for each fuel as a result of the balancing effects that take place between fuels when
combining sensitivities. For example, while emissions from oil use are reduced in the faster
EV growth sensitivity, this is counteracted, albeit to a lesser extent, by slightly higher power
sector emissions due to increased electricity demand.

The changes from the STEPS presented by the sensitivity analysis here for oil, natural gas and

Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario for the same year.

Uncertainties in oil demand

Oil demand peaks by 2030 in the STEPS after increasing by about 2.6 million barrels per day
(mb/d) from 2023 to 2030. Within this decade, rising sales of EVs and improvements in fuel
efficiency lead to petrochemicals taking over from road transport as the main contributor to
oil demand growth. The pace of EV sales and the role of PHEVs are two key uncertainties for
the oil outlook, and the degree of oil-to-gas switching in the power sector in countries in the
Middle East is a third. Exploring and combining these sensitivities, we find that global oil
demand peaks within a few years of that for the STEPS in the high demand case with an
additional 1.7 mb/d of oil use, and in the low case with 0.7 mb/d less use of oil (Figure 4.3).
By 2035, oil demand across the sensitivities ranges from 97 mb/d to 102 mb/d.

4.4.1

Electric vehicle pace of growth

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

EVs are one of the key factors tempering future oil demand. Annual electric car sales rise
from 14 million today to over 40 million in 2030 and nearly 60 million in 2035 in the STEPS.
This shift to EVs displaces over 6 mb/d of oil demand by 2030 and 13 mb/d in 2035, with
most of the savings deriving from passenger cars. However, the amount of oil displaced
depends heavily on how quickly EV sales continue to increase.
Electric car sales were up by around 25% year-on-year in the first half of 2024, with China
accounting for about 80% of this increase. Some regions like Asia show robust growth, and
North America has seen a rise of nearly 13%. But sales are rising more slowly in other parts

of the world for various reasons. For example, some EV subsidies in the European Union have
been phased out, and more stringent CO2 emissions standards are not due to take effect until
2025 (see Chapter 1). A wide range of factors will affect the future rate of EV uptake,
including policy support, fuel and emissions standards, the extent to which more affordable
EV models become available, the rollout of charging infrastructure, consumer preferences
and company strategies.
The market share of new electric passenger cars sold in the STEPS reaches about 45% by
2030. In the Slower EV growth case, this figure decreases by close to ten percentage points.
In the Faster EV growth case, it increases by close to five percentage points, and the impact
becomes more pronounced beyond 2030, particularly in emerging market and developing
economies outside China as they significantly expand their car fleets: as a result, the market
share of electric cars reaches two-thirds by 2035 in the Faster EV growth case, compared
with just over 55% in the STEPS during the same period.

Slower EV growth, higher oil demand
Certain regions are at higher risk of slowdown in EV sales than others, especially those with
strong policies or ambitious goals that may be delayed, cancelled or fail to be met. The risks
are particularly acute as markets transition from early adoption of EVs to a phase in which
EVs account for the majority of sales.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the United States, for instance, there is uncertainty about the future evolution of
greenhouse gas emission standards, and the path that is taken will have significant
implications for future EV demand. Any slowdown in the United States, which accounts for
about 85% of the entire North American car market, could have ripple effects throughout
the region. In the European Union, a review of its CO2 standards in 2026 will assess progress
toward achieving 2035 targets, and its outcome is likely to have implications for the speed
of EV adoption in EU member countries. Elsewhere, some advanced economies in Asia are
facing challenges to increase their EV market share to levels that are comparable to those in
other advanced economy markets, while recently announced EV targets in Australia may
require additional support measures. Even in China – the largest EV market – PHEVs now
account for over 30% of total electric car sales, suggesting that consumers still have concerns
about range anxiety arising from a perceived lack of adequate charging infrastructure.
In this sensitivity case, we assume that these various risks lead to electric car sales being
around 10% lower than in the STEPS by 2035. Electric car sales in the United States are close
to 10% lower than in the STEPS, and sales in the European Union are 5% lower. Most of the
rest of the reduction is in China, where sales are assumed to be around 7% lower than in the
STEPS. As a result of these changes, oil demand is around 2 mb/d higher in 2035 than in the
STEPS, with the United States and China being key sources of variations (Figure 4.4). This
does not affect the timing of peak oil demand projected in the STEPS: the peak still comes by
the end of the decade, but at a level of around 103 mb/d rather than below 102 mb/d as
projected in the STEPS.

Slower EV uptake increases oil demand by 2 mb/d in 2035, of which 60% is from the United
States and European Union; faster EV uptake mostly reduces oil demand in other EMDE
Note: AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

Faster EV growth, lower oil demand
Emerging market and developing economies outside China offer an opportunity to accelerate
EV uptake. Spare Chinese EV manufacturing capacity could feed into growing demand in
these economies, especially those with established trade routes to China, and they could
introduce further domestic measures to support this growth.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Car production utilisation rates, encompassing both internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles and EVs, in China are low, at around 50% of total manufacturing capacity. Typical
car plants in other regions operate at about 70% capacity on average. While car production
utilisation rates in China could exceed 90% for a few large EV manufacturers, there is excess
capacity available that could produce 5 million more EVs annually. This could feed demand
from emerging market and developing economies as they mature. Plans to scale up domestic
EV production in parts of Asia and Latin America could also meet growing demand.
In this sensitivity case, we increased global electric car sales by an additional 11 million in
2035, on top of the over 55 million electric car sales that already feature in the STEPS
(Figure 4.5). We assumed that these additional sales would mostly be in emerging market
and developing economies outside China. This leads to a reduction in oil demand of 1.8 mb/d
in 2035. The reduction does not affect the date when of peak global oil demand is reached
in the STEPS: the peak still comes by the end of this decade, albeit at a level approximately
0.3 mb/d lower than in the STEPS.

PHEV in electric mode operation

The share of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in total electric car sales has fluctuated between
25% and 40% since 2015. There has been significant recent growth in PHEV sales, particularly
in China, where they increased by 80% in 2023 – a far bigger increase than by battery electric
cars, which saw sales rise by over 20%. There are several underlying reasons, the most
important of which is that PHEV powertrains largely overcome range anxiety by combining
the benefits of both conventional engines and EVs. The trend in China is also attributed in
part to the introduction of new PHEV models, given that the market was previously
dominated by battery electric models.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Despite playing a strong role in the EV mix in the short term, sales of PHEVs are likely to drop
rapidly after 2030 as an increasing number of more affordable battery electric models
becomes available and as advances in battery technology and the rollout of charging
infrastructure alleviate range anxiety. However, the critical factor for PHEVs is how
consumers operate them. Studies have shown that electric mode use typically accounts for
between 20% and 40% of the annual mileage (ICCT, 2022). Incentives such as access to lowemissions zones for PHEVs operating solely in electric mode, along with government efforts
to ensure affordable electricity prices, could boost the use of electric mode in PHEVs.
Employing electric mode usage as a factor, we constructed two sensitivity cases with
different oil demand trends: a more electric mode operation case which increases the current
levels of electric propulsion by over 30 percentage points by 2035, and a less electric mode
176

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

operation case which holds the proportion of PHEV electric propulsion at current levels. In
the case where electric mode use stagnates, PHEVs lead to an increase in oil demand by
around 100 thousand barrels per day (kb/d) by 2035; in the case where electric propulsion
increases, oil demand declines by 250 kb/d over the same period.

4.4.3

Oil-to-gas switching in the Middle East power sector

Oil remains an important part of the electricity mix in the Middle East. The region currently
consumes around 1.7 mb/d of oil every year in the power sector alone, equivalent to the
total oil demand of Indonesia. Around 340 terawatt-hours (TWh) were generated by oil-fired
power plants in 2023, providing 25% of total electricity supply in the region. The largest user
of oil-fired power in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, generating nearly half of the total in
2022: it is home to the world’s largest oil-fired plant, which consumes around 200 kb/d on
peak days. Other major users of oil-fired power are Iran (over 20% of the regional total)
Kuwait (18%), Iraq (8%), Syria (5%) and Lebanon (1%).
There is much uncertainty, however, about the amount of oil that will be used in the
electricity sector in the Middle East over the next decade. While electricity demand is
projected to rise rapidly, the largest users of oil in power are making efforts to shift away
from oil to natural gas and renewable energy sources. For instance, the Vision 2030
programme in Saudi Arabia aims to phase out oil for power generation by 2030, though
specific plans to achieve this objective have not yet been established. High dependence on
oil in the power sector is a point of concern to many countries in the region, and
consideration is being given to how to reduce its use. For example, in Iraq, where there has
been recent progress in switching to natural gas and where there are ambitions to increase
the availability of natural gas for power through the elimination of flaring before 2030.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Taking into consideration these policies and factors, Middle East oil demand in the power
sector declines by about 900 kb/d to 2030 in the STEPS, while natural gas demand in the
power sector increases by over 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) and renewable electricity
generation increases sixfold. In a case where transitions away from oil are delayed in
Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other countries in the region, oil use in the power sector could decline
by less than it does in the STEPS, and in consequence oil demand could be some 500 kb/d
higher in 2030 than in the STEPS. On the other hand, in a case where transitions away from
oil proceed more quickly than in the STEPS, including through more rapid switching to natural
gas and renewables, oil use in the power sector could be further reduced by around 250 kb/d
in 2030 compared to the STEPS. 1

1 The competition between natural gas and renewables in the Middle East is also an important uncertainty,

but outside the scope of this analysis.

Shipping chokepoints

International navigation accounts for 4% of global oil demand. Some international
shipping routes pass through chokepoints, which are narrow waterways that connect
larger bodies of water. These chokepoints pose a risk of disruption to shipping routes,
whether caused by a natural disaster, accident, geopolitical conflict or piracy acts.
Examples include the Strait of Malacca, the Danish Straits and the Strait of Gibraltar.
Two key global chokepoints are the Suez Canal and Panama Canal, where security
concerns, geopolitics, weather and operational issues have all recently had impacts.
The Panama Canal saw capacity restrictions throughout much of 2023 caused by a
drought that reduced water levels. The average number of ships permitted to pass was
about 10% lower than typical levels.
The Suez Canal has seen more dramatic impacts. It was temporarily blocked for six days
in 2021. Since December 2023, security risks from Houthi activity in the vicinity of the
Bab al-Mandab Strait have reduced the number of cargo and tanker ships passing
through the canal by about 50%. The alternative route around Africa via the Cape of Good
Hope involves a significantly longer journey. For example, the journey from Singapore to
Rotterdam by sea would be over 40% longer if ships could not pass through the Red Sea.
This has implications for both activity and energy demand.
If all international ships were to avoid or lose access to the Suez Canal, the longer
distances they would have to travel would mean an increase of nearly 10% in tonnekilometres travelled. Additional energy requirements for the more circuitous route might
well be compounded by some operators increasing shipping speeds to meet delivery
deadlines. We estimate that the net effect could increase oil demand in shipping by
around 330 kb/d during 2024.

Uncertainties in natural gas demand

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

While global natural gas demand increases by about 250 bcm from 2023 to a peak of
4 400 bcm in the late-2020s in the STEPS, global gas markets remain well supplied. A wave
of new LNG supply coming to market, together with other factors, applies downward
pressure on the price of LNG exports in the STEPS (see Chapter 1). The response to these
price reductions is uncertain and could lead to global natural gas demand increasing faster
than projected in the STEPS in order to clear available supply. We find that the LNG surplus
of around 130 bcm in 2030 in the STEPS could lead to higher demand for natural gas, with
some of it being used for electricity generation, heating and industry. This would displace the
fuels that would otherwise have been used, such as oil in power, coal in industry and
electricity in buildings, including heat pumps. 2 In addition, we analyse the implications for

coal-to-gas switching in the power sector (see Chapter 1).

178

natural gas demand related to uncertainties in the pace of renewables deployment and
electricity demand growth.
Combining these uncertainties, we find that the effects would see a peak within a few years
of that for the STEPS (Figure 4.6), although there are circumstances that could see growth
beyond this range (see Box 1.6 in Chapter 1). On the other hand, faster solar PV deployment
and lower electricity demand growth could see an earlier peak in natural gas demand and a
more significant decline to 2030 and 2035.

Note: bcm = billion cubic metres.

4.5.1

LNG oversupply

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, LNG demand increases by 145 bcm between 2023 and 2030, while export
capacity expands by around 270 bcm, loosening global gas markets (Figure 4.7). This puts
downward pressure on natural gas prices, which in the STEPS average around USD 6.5 per
million British thermal units (MBtu) in the European Union in 2030, USD 7/MBtu in China and
around USD 8/MBtu in Japan. This is almost half the levels seen in the European Union in
2023, and about 35% lower in China and Japan. Existing LNG export capacity and new
capacity under construction is sufficient to meet projected demand in the STEPS until 2040.
This suggests that no further projects are required in the near term to satisfy demand for
LNG.
Compared with previous waves of LNG supply growth, there are now fewer buyers that are
obliged to take volumes of gas on long-term take-or-pay contracts. Around one-third of the
capacity under construction is as-yet uncontracted, meaning these additional volumes will
Chapter 4 | Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook

179

be made available on the spot market from suppliers or portfolio players with equity stakes
in the terminals. With the increasing liquidity and flexibility of global LNG supply, there is a
high degree of uncertainty about which markets and sectors have the capacity to absorb
these additional volumes of gas. This is compounded by uncertainties about production: in
some cases, this might fall faster than anticipated, e.g. Bangladesh or Thailand, and in others
it might surprise on the upside, for example in China.

There is additional surplus of around 130 bcm of LNG by 2030 in the STEPS based on current
project announcements; this surplus declines after 2030 as LNG capacity reduces
Note: LNG capacity is derated to 90% of nameplate capacity to account for maintenance, outages and
upstream supply availability.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

On the import side, there is significant LNG regasification capacity of around 1 500 bcm today
– more than double the amount of export capacity – and a further 200 bcm is being built.
Around 40% of the new capacity is being built in China. Europe is also increasing its ability to
import LNG and by 2030 its regasification capacity is set to reach 370 bcm per year, which is
50% higher than it was before Russia invaded Ukraine. Overall, there are relatively few
infrastructure-related constraints to increasing LNG use, barring some bottlenecks to reach
new centres of gas demand in India.
We explored a sensitivity case where the LNG surplus and the resulting downward pressure
on prices in the STEPS stimulates additional demand above the level in the STEPS of around
75 bcm by 2030. This additional demand raises overall LNG capacity utilisation from 80% in
the STEPS in 2030 to 90%, closer to current levels of around 95%. Most of the incremental
volume comes from existing projects in the United States, with the remainder supplied
principally by Canada, Qatar and exporters in Nigeria and Mozambique. The upward
180

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

adjustment to demand pulls forward the date at which new LNG export capacity is needed.
Whereas in the STEPS, current projects are able to meet demand to 2040, in this sensitivity
case a supply gap opens in the mid-2030s and around 60 bcm of new capacity is required by
2040.
There are several potential sources of this incremental supply, but many face challenges.
Current projects in East Africa have been delayed by security concerns, while difficulties
developing upstream resources have tempered export capacity growth in West Africa and
Australia. Russian LNG supply growth is meanwhile hobbled by sanctions, while possible
projects in other countries with export ambitions, such as Saudi Arabia, are at a very early
stage of development. On the other hand, Qatar and the United States, which dominate
today’s pipeline of new projects, look well-placed to develop more capacity in the long term.
Canada and Argentina are also in a strong position to ramp up gas exports now that they are
completing planned infrastructure to transport gas from inland fields to coastal terminals.

4.5.2

Higher natural gas demand uncertainties

The power sector is the largest user of natural gas, consuming about 40% of the total in 2023.
Any changes in power sector demand for natural gas could therefore have a significant effect
on overall natural gas demand. Two of the most important potential changes that could raise
natural gas use in the power sector are an acceleration in the pace of electricity demand
growth (section 4.6) and delays or reductions in expansion of renewables. We find that
changes of this kind, together with increased oil-to-gas switching in the Middle East, could
raise natural gas demand in the power sector by 100 bcm in 2030. The majority of that
increase would be in gas-importing countries, which together would take up a significant
portion of the LNG surplus. In our analysis, the effects are largest in China, the European
Union and Southeast Asia, though there are also smaller effects in many other countries
(Figure 4.8). Among exporting countries, these uncertainties would affect natural gas
demand in the power sector the most in the United States, followed by countries in the
Middle East.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There are of course many other uncertainties in the power sector. For example, there could
be significant policy changes, such as additional measures in some countries to accelerate
transitions away from coal-fired power, or a change of position on nuclear power. There
could also be more coal-to-gas switching in the power sector than projected in the STEPS if
gas prices were to fall to levels below those projected. However, we have had to be selective
in choosing uncertainties for consideration, and these fall outside the scope of this analysis.
In the power sector, uncertainties concerning the pace of expansion for wind power are
especially relevant for gas demand. In the STEPS, global wind power is projected to increase
rapidly and to double by 2030: these projections reflect policy support for wind power in
over 60 countries, widespread resource availability and proven low-cost technology. The link
between wind power and natural gas use in the power sector is particularly important in the
European Union and the United States, regions where the wind industry has recently faced
Chapter 4 | Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook

181

4

challenges, creating some uncertainty about the pace at which deployment is likely to be
scaled up in the coming years. The main challenges are from supply chain issues, permitting
and licensing hold-ups, grid connection queues, and with tightening profit margins due to
fixed price contracts and increases in equipment costs. Onshore wind development is most
affected by the challenges arising from permitting, licensing and grid queues, and offshore
wind by those arising in the supply chain and related financial challenges. A number of US
offshore projects were cancelled or delayed in 2023, which are already reflected in the STEPS,
but the challenges for offshore wind could last longer than projected. There has also been a
reduction in the level of participation in recent wind power auctions in the European Union.

Uncertainties for natural gas are dominated by the power sector, but uncertainties
are also significant in industry and buildings in gas-importing countries

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Such uncertainties could reduce expansion of wind power to 2035 by almost 20% in the
United States, and almost 15% in the European Union, cutting installed wind capacity in 2035
by nearly 80 gigawatts (GW) (Figure 4.9). The impact of delayed deployment of wind power
in the United States would be an extra 23 bcm of natural gas demand in 2030 and over
30 bcm in 2035, while in the European Union it would lead to an extra 7 bcm of gas demand
in 2030 and 9 bcm in 2035. The solar industry faces some of the same challenges, including
grid connection queues and permitting and licensing problems in some instances, but its
supply chains are in a stronger state.
Additional growth for electricity demand could also raise the level of natural gas demand in
the power sector. In advanced economies, a faster rise in electricity demand that outstripped
the growth of renewables would be likely to prompt turning to natural gas to fill the gap. In
emerging market and developing economies, where coal is the primary source of electricity,
a faster than expected increase in electricity demand would lead to additional use of coal,
182

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

but it would also mean a search for additional natural gas in many instances, particularly in
Southeast Asia. As discussed, the extent of oil-to-gas switching in the Middle East is another
major uncertainty.

Whether due to permitting, licensing, grid connection or other issues, even modest delays
in wind power deployment could have a real impact on natural gas demand

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

We have also assessed the potential for a larger response from the industry sector to lower
natural gas price resulting from the LNG surplus. Lower prices could lead to faster
displacement of coal and oil boilers by natural gas in China, India and Southeast Asia without
changing the rate of electrification. In non-energy-intensive industry, where most of this
displacement occurs, the average rate of replacement for natural gas boilers increases to
2.3% per year in the sensitivity case compared with 0.6% in the STEPS by 2030. This results
in gas demand increasing by 23 bcm in 2030 compared to the STEPS, displacing 13 million
tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) of coal demand and 0.3 mb/d of oil demand. We assume
that distribution infrastructure is able to meet this additional demand, though that may be
challenging in some cases, notably in India and Southeast Asia.
Lower natural gas prices in the years ahead could also lead to larger increases in demand for
natural gas for ammonia production as a result of existing coal-based production plants in
China and Southeast Asia being converted to gas faster than projected in the STEPS, though
the effect on gas demand is much smaller than that arising from the displacement of oil and
gas boilers in industry. In the sensitivity case, this switch results in additional gas demand of
around 3 bcm for ammonia production by 2030, which displaces another 4 Mtce of coal
demand.

Chapter 4 | Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook

183

Lower natural gas prices could also have a larger impact on the buildings sector by delaying
moves away from gas-fired heating to heat pumps. Heat pump growth slowed in 2023 as the
market consolidated after a significant surge in 2022 which was probably driven by the
energy crisis. Growth is expected to pick up again. The STEPS projects growth in the stock of
heat pumps by two-thirds by 2030. However, China and the European Union, which account
for more than 40% of the current global heat pump stock, remain particularly vulnerable to
the risk that the lower gas prices in the STEPS could further slow the pace of gas boiler
replacements. In the sensitivity case, heat pump sales could be reduced by 20% in the
European Union and China, resulting in a 10% reduction in stock by 2030 compared with the
STEPS: this increases gas demand by 14 bcm, displacing 50 TWh of electricity by 2030.

4.5.3

Lower natural gas demand uncertainties

Solar PV deployment is a major success story in global clean energy transitions. Installed solar
capacity has roughly doubled every three years since 2015, and this increase has been
accompanied by similar expansion in solar PV manufacturing capacity. Existing solar PV
module manufacturing capacities are more than sufficient to produce over 900 GW of
solar PV modules, which is the level of capacity additions required in the NZE Scenario by
2030; announcements of planned new capacity would increase this to almost 1 400 GW, or
more than 50% above the NZE Scenario level, assuming that these plans proceed. Existing
overcapacity has contributed to a 90% reduction in solar PV costs since 2010, but it has also
put at risk the competitiveness of the industry, with the STEPS projecting a utilisation rate
for solar module manufacturing of just 50% by 2030.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

If manufacturing overcapacity persists, there is potential for a larger response to the low
solar PV costs projected in the STEPS, with even faster solar PV growth, especially in emerging
market and developing economies, despite challenging financing conditions. In this
sensitivity case, we assess to what extent such an acceleration might displace fossil fuel
power plants, and what the impact of would be. 3 We project that solar PV capacity additions
might increase by 60 GW in 2030 compared to the STEPS, which would mean an average 55%
utilisation rate for manufacturing capacity. This would reduce natural gas-fired power
generation by 180 TWh in 2030 and about 330 TWh in 2035, saving close to 40 bcm and
almost 70 bcm of natural gas respectively, alongside reductions for coal-fired power. In the
modelling, two-thirds of the reductions in natural gas use by 2035 are in China and Southeast
Asia, where solar PV manufacturing capacity is concentrated, and the other third in countries
in Africa. Faster solar PV deployment would also cut coal-fired power in many regions. The
combined effect of these changes would bring an additional 280 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide (Mt CO2) emissions reductions in 2035 compared with the STEPS.
Uncertainties concerning the pace of electricity demand growth could vary the level of
natural gas demand in the power sector. Global electricity demand could be reduced by as
much as 2%, in turn reducing the global demand for natural gas by around 50 bcm in 2030
3 We carried out a similar analysis in the high solar PV case in the World Energy Outlook 2023.

184

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

(section 4.6.4). About two-thirds of this demand reduction would likely take place in
emerging market and developing economies, where the uncertainties for electricity demand
growth are largest, and would principally affect India and Southeast Asia, with more modest
impacts in the Middle East, Africa and China. While advanced economies are more reliant on
gas-fired power, the uncertainties they face about electricity demand growth are more
circumscribed. The sensitivity case nevertheless sees a decline in demand for natural gas of
around 30 bcm compared with the STEPS as a result of uncertainties about the speed of
growth in electricity demand for EVs, appliances and data centres. This principally affects the
United States, which sees demand fall by almost 17 bcm compared with the STEPS, with most
of the rest of the reduction in the European Union.

4.6

Uncertainties in electricity demand

Electricity demand in the STEPS increases at an annual average rate of 3% from 2023 to 2035.
Many of the key drivers relate to emerging market and developing economies, where rising
populations and incomes result in higher levels of demand as more buildings are constructed
and as more people buy and use appliances and air conditioners. Demand for cooling has
already led to a rapid rise in the sale and use of air conditioners, which is expected to
continue. Heat waves are likely to become more frequent and intense with climate change,
increasing both the demand for and costs of cooling (see Box 5.4 in Chapter 5). Data centres
are another cause of rising electricity demand, linked in part to expanding use of AI.

Electricity demand increases strongly in the STEPS, but several plausible

Chapter 4 | Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook

185

With these drivers in mind, we evaluated key uncertainties related to data centre demand,
appliance efficiency and heat waves, together with EV growth (section 4.4.1). Our sensitivity
case finds that, in aggregate, the average annual growth rate from 2023 to 2035 moves up
to 3.4% in the high case and down to 2.7% in the low case. While shifts of this size would be
important, they would not deflect the continuing and inexorable rise of electricity demand.
Meeting higher electricity demand has near-term implications in our sensitivity case for both
gas-fired and coal-fired power, particularly the latter, which in the modelling would see
demand rise by 4% at the global level in 2030 (Figure 4.10).

4.6.1

Data centres

In early 2024, over 11 000 data centres were registered worldwide. The number of servers
installed increased around 4% per year between 2010 and 2020, but data centre electricity
demand broadly plateaued as increasing information technology (IT) demands were
mitigated by efficiency improvements in cooling and by workloads moving to larger and more
efficient cloud data centres. In recent years, however, electricity consumption has picked up
as efficiency improvements have been outpaced by surging demand for data centre services.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Data centre electricity consumption was estimated in 2022 to be in the range of 240 to
340 TWh, around 1% to 1.3% of total electricity consumption (excluding data networks and
crypto mining). Although AI currently accounts for a relatively small share of global data
centre electricity consumption, it is emerging as a new driver of growth. Investment in AI and
new data centres is booming. The global venture capital sector has invested over
USD 225 billion in AI startups over the past five years, compared to USD 143 billion over the
same period in startups operating across all aspects of the clean energy sector. Driven in part
by data centres and AI, capital spending by US technology giants Alphabet (Google), Meta
(Facebook), Amazon and Microsoft reached around USD 150 billion in 2023, up by more than
a factor of two on the 2019 level and equivalent to around 0.5% of US gross domestic
product. Interest is not confined to advanced economies, with China, India and other
emerging market and developing economies also seeing robust growth in data centres.
A substantial increase in electricity consumption from data centres appears inevitable (IEA,
2024). However, several factors make projections challenging. First, the supply chain is highly
concentrated around a few bottlenecks, particularly for the chips that handle AI and other
compute-intensive workloads. Taiwan Semiconductor, which holds more than a 90% share
of the market for AI related chips, has announced investments to meet expected demand for
their most advanced chips, and plans to open new factories in 2026, but it is currently limited
to existing infrastructure. Average lead times for new chip fabrication plants are 3-5 years.
Second, efficiency gains are hard to model. They have recently been substantial: NVIDIA's
Blackwell Platform cut energy consumption by around 75% compared to the previous
generation of graphics processing unit (GPU) chips. In addition, there is potential for
algorithmic optimisation to reduce future computational load. However, more efficient chips
may also increase demand due to the rebound effect, and energy efficiency improvements
appear unlikely to fully offset the growing service demands due in part to AI. Third, any or all
186

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

of the electricity network, generation capacity and permitting processes may constrain the
rate of data centre expansion.
There are also policy-related uncertainties. On one hand, governments have enacted
industrial and localisation policies to support development of domestic value chains for chips
and data centres. On the other hand, trade restrictions on key physical components, e.g.
certain chips and chip tools, at the global level, or data centre construction limits at the local
level, could slow developments.
Furthermore, data availability presents substantial challenges for analysts to assess the
outlook for data centre electricity demand, in contrast to other more traditional parts of the
energy system, where data collection processes are more standardised.
The evolution of demand for data centres and AI services is thus highly uncertain. Major
investment in AI startups and computing resources are being made, but the nature, speed
and scale of end-use adoption is still unclear. For these reasons, projections should be made

Total electricity demand across all sectors is set to increase by around 6 760 TWh by 2030 in
the STEPS, equivalent to more than the electricity demand of the European Union and the
United States combined in 2023. The main drivers of this increase are the electrification of
transport, industrial processes and space heating, and rising demand for appliances and

cooling equipment. In the STEPS, about 80% of additional electricity demand for 2023-2030
is in emerging market and developing economies. Data centre demand grows strongly but
provides a relatively small contribution to overall electricity demand growth (Figure 4.11).
Driven by the rising demand for both AI and more conventional data centre services, global
server capacity is expected to more than double by 2030. After a decade of substantial
technical efficiency improvements and on the back of an increase in more energy-intensive
data centre workloads, notably for AI, the rate of technical efficiency gains is expected to
flatten (Masanet, 2020) (Uptime Institute, 2023). Consequently, global data centre electricity
demand is anticipated to increase significantly by the end of this decade, with the scale
dependent on technological advances in IT equipment and hardware deployment. In the
base case, data centres account for less than 10% of total electricity demand growth at the
global level, which is roughly on a par with demand growth for desalination, and less than a
third of the demand growth for both EVs and space cooling in the buildings sector.
Therefore, growth of electricity demand for data centres is projected to be rapid, but the
level looks set to remain relatively small in the context of overall global demand growth.
Nevertheless, data centre operators are now among the most active clean electricity
purchasers as clean electricity supply becomes central to their sustainability strategies
(BNEF, 2024). The top ten corporate buyers of clean energy power purchase agreements
(PPAs) in 2023 included Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft. Between 2023 and 2030,
total data centre demand growth is projected to be just below 50% of the annual global
increase in low-emissions sources of electricity over the last five years, so meeting this
demand growth sustainably is feasible. However, data centres are very spatially
concentrated, and constraints on generation and grid capacity may be more severe at the
local level (Figure 4.12).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The clustering of data centres is driven by the benefits of proximity to infrastructure such as
fibre optic cables and power resources; to customers, particularly those with a need for nearreal time access to data, like financial services companies; and to existing business
ecosystems and talent pools. Location decisions are also driven by incentives and regulation,
and by climatic considerations: cooler places have lower cooling needs. Spatial concentration
is already creating tensions, with several jurisdictions issuing moratoria on further data
centre development or taking steps to restrict it.
Overall, significant electricity demand increase from data centres is inevitable, but the extent
of growth is uncertain. In any likely scenario, however, data centres look set to remain a
relatively small driver of overall electricity demand growth at the global level in the decade
to come. Nonetheless, constraints at the local level may be significant. To ensure that the
outlook for data centre demand growth is better understood and that actual growth is met
sustainably, policy makers, the energy industry and the technology sector need to work more
closely together to enhance data sharing, strengthen regulatory dialogue, improve
efficiencies, scale up low-emissions electricity supply and mitigate local bottlenecks.

4.6.2

Heat waves

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global temperatures are rising as the climate changes, and 2023 was the warmest year on
record. In addition to climatological shifts and their impact on the average global surface
temperature, there has been an increased prevalence of extreme temperatures in the form
of more intense, frequent and persistent heat waves, some of which have led to notable
temperature records. Recent examples include highs of almost 50 degrees Celsius (°C) over
three days in western Canada (2021), highs exceeding 40 °C in the United Kingdom (2022),
and extended heat waves over much of India during May/June 2024 and parts of China in
August 2024.
One consequence of more intense, frequent and longer heat waves is expected to be an
increase in ownership of air conditioners. Consumers buy units to stay cool in high
temperatures and to be prepared for expected future heatwaves. For example, heat waves
in India during 2024 are understood to have prompted a doubling of air conditioner sales. As
conditions get hotter, air conditioners are used more often, and they also have to work
harder to keep buildings and people cool. Space cooling is already one of the fastest growing
sources of electricity demand and it plays a significant role in increasing the level of peak
demand for electricity (see Chapter 5). The combination of increased use and ownership is
cumulative and accelerates electricity demand growth. The energy demand curve also shifts
with higher peak consumption levels that could jeopardise system security.
Chapter 4 | Exploring uncertainties in the Outlook

189

For the sensitivity case, we considered a world where more frequent, more intense and
longer heat waves mean that levels of cooling demand in aggregate are higher than in the
STEPS. It concentrates on what cooling from high temperatures would mean for electricity
demand. We assessed heat waves by considering the historic distribution of cooling degree
days and assuming more periods in the higher, hotter end of the spread. In addition, we
factored in an accelerated pace of air conditioner ownership acquisition. The results indicate
that electricity demand would be around 500 TWh higher in 2030 in this sensitivity case,
compared to the STEPS, and almost 700 TWh higher in 2035, which is around 20% of total
cooling demand in the buildings sector in that year in the STEPS (Figure 4.13).

in the STEPS by 2035, mostly in emerging market and developing economies

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: AE = advanced economies; EMDE = emerging market and developing economies.

More than 80% of the electricity demand increase compared to the STEPS occurs in emerging
market and developing economies, notably India, China and Southeast Asia, due to their
climate and their relatively low air conditioner ownership rates, and cooling demand
increases by an average of 25% compared to the STEPS. In advanced economies, cooling
demand increases by just over 10% since air conditioner ownership is already near saturation
levels in regions in which it is needed. We find that average air conditioner ownership rates
would be 16% higher in 2035, a level not seen until after 2040 in the STEPS, which drives 70%
of the demand increase. In most regions, this demand increase has to be met by additional
dispatchable generation because cooling demand is concentrated in a few months of the
year. Since this type of generation is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, gas and coal consumption
would each increase by 2% by 2030, resulting in 270 Mt of additional CO2 emissions.

4.6.3

Appliance efficiency in emerging market and developing economies

Acquisition and use of an expanding array of electrical appliances and cooling equipment is
a key driver of rising electricity consumption in fast-growing emerging market and
developing economies in the STEPS (see Chapter 3). Energy consumption in the buildings
sector from space cooling and appliances is set to increase in the STEPS by 35% to 2030 and
60% by 2035. This is primarily driven by growth in population and floorspace, increased
ownership of appliances and improved living standards.
Energy efficiency improvements, supported by strong policy measures, can help to moderate
this growth which is reflected in the STEPS. Rates of efficiency improvements, however, have
varied widely in the past across emerging market and developing economies as a result of
differing policies and standards together with uneven implementation, and the scope for
efficiency improvements is at risk of being severely curtailed by the continued sale of
obsolete and inefficient air conditioners and other appliances in some emerging market and
developing economies. Without appropriate standards, regulation and effective
enforcement, consumers could be locked into old, inefficient technologies for many years.
The difficulty of assessing the scale of future energy efficiency improvements against this
background creates potential uncertainties for the STEPS projections which we have
analysed in the following cases.

Low appliance efficiency, high demand case
Markets with strong minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) only cover a limited
share of global demand for cooling appliances. This provides incentives for appliance
manufacturers to maintain distinct product ranges for those countries with MEPS and those
without, or to specialise in less efficient products with cheaper upfront costs. Our high
demand case assumes that, for the end-uses considered, weak or delayed efficiency policies
reduce the rate of efficiency improvement by one-third. The effect of this is to increase
electricity demand in the buildings sector in emerging market and developing economies by
170 TWh by 2030 and 340 TWh by 2035, compared to the STEPS, which is equivalent to 3%
to 5% of cooling and appliances demand. The impact is amplified over time by economic
growth and increased appliance ownership. There are wide regional disparities, with India
seeing the largest impact from poor air conditioner efficiency at about 30% of the total
increase in electricity demand (Figure 4.14).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

High appliance efficiency, low demand case
In the low demand case, the number of markets with strong MEPS expands to reach critical
mass, so that international companies choose to comply with standards across all their global
operations in order to avoid the costs of maintaining separate product ranges for markets
with MEPS and those without, and manufacturers specialising in inefficient goods are
gradually squeezed out. As a result, more efficient appliances are rolled out worldwide. Our
low demand case assumes that widespread MEPS and efficiency labelling lead to efficiency
levels equivalent to those in the APS. This results in electricity demand 400 TWh lower in
2030 than in the STEPS, and almost 900 TWh lower by 2035, equating to 13% of cooling and

appliances demand in the buildings sector. Highly efficient standards benefit China the most,
due to its economic development and high growth in ownership rates, and it accounts for
almost 45% of the demand reduction.

Implications of changes in electricity demand

Meeting higher or lower electricity demand growth than projected in the STEPS has
implications for the supply of electricity that vary by region related to the available fleet of
power plants. The operations of existing power plants could be varied in many cases to meet
higher or lower electricity demand, though new construction could be needed to meet higher
electricity demand that persists, while lower demand could lead to earlier retirements of
some power plants.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Meeting higher electricity demand
In the short term, faster electricity demand growth would be met largely by operating
existing power plants more often, in particular coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. In
advanced economies, this would generally mean higher levels of natural gas-fired power. In
some cases, higher demand may also require new power capacity to ensure that peak
demand can be met. In the STEPS, the average capacity factor of natural gas-fired power
plants in advanced economies declines from 36% in 2023 to 31% in 2030 and 26% in 2035. If
they had to meet the higher demand seen in the sensitivity case, the average capacity factor
for gas-fired power plants would still decline over time, but it would do so at a slower rate.
192

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

In emerging market and developing economies, the large fleet of coal-fired power plants is
capable of significantly increasing output to meet higher levels of demand. However, even
with the additional electricity demand growth explored here, the average capacity factor of
coal-fired power in emerging market and developing economies still declines from 2023 to
2030, even though coal-fired power generation is 4% higher in 2030 than in the STEPS.
In the longer term, new renewables capacity could be built by the late 2020s and early 2030s
to meet nearly 85% of higher electricity demand. As solar PV and wind are already the
cheapest new sources of electricity in most regions today, it is likely that they would be
deployed to meet persistently higher levels of electricity demand, thus mitigating the
additional total output from coal- and natural gas-fired power plants (Figure 4.15).

Meeting lower electricity demand

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Lower growth in electricity demand would drive faster reductions of fossil fuels to 2030 and
beyond. Natural gas-fired power in 2030 is 4% lower in this sensitivity case than in the STEPS,
and coal-fired power is 4.5% lower, while oil use in the power sector is largely unchanged.
Collectively, the changes in fossil fuel-fired power would reduce CO2 emissions by 520 Mt in
2030.
Renewables, nuclear power and other low-emissions sources are largely unchanged by lower
electricity demand growth. Many countries have targets to increase installed capacity or the
low-emissions share of generation based on specific electricity demand expectations. Where
electricity demand growth turns out to be lower, we project that most of those countries are
likely to choose to overshoot their share targets rather than to seek to slow deployment of
renewables.

Security, affordability and sustainability
Finding the right balance
S U M M A R Y
• Policy makers need to balance goals related to energy security, affordability and
sustainability. Some policy choices can simultaneously boost all three, but many
require trade-offs. A critical challenge is to minimise the trade-offs and to help avoid
a narrow focus on one that unwittingly compromises the others.

• Fuel security remains a vital element of energy security. Disruption in a major
producing region or at today’s trade chokepoints, including the Straits of Hormuz and
Malacca, could lead to severe price volatility. Maintaining reliable fuel infrastructure
and the systems they depend on is essential to support security in energy transitions
and facilitate the scaling up of low-emissions fuels.

• Electricity security is high on the agenda as increasing demand and more variable
generation sources highlight the importance of secure, resilient and flexible power
systems. Batteries are rapidly scaling up to provide short-term flexibility; demand
response can provide short-term and some seasonal flexibility while also helping to
keep costs down; thermal power and hydropower are the main sources of seasonal
flexibility today and are set to remain so through to 2050.

• The security of clean energy supply chains and of critical minerals supply is of pivotal
importance to clean energy transitions. Clean energy manufacturing capacities are
well above deployment levels today, but facilities are highly concentrated
geographically. Critical minerals supply is also highly concentrated, and there is risk of
future gaps between prospective supply and demand for copper and lithium.

• Issues of affordability and fairness are at the centre of the energy debate today. Clean
energy transitions can help reduce household bills, but this depends on a sharp
increase in investment and on support for those that cannot afford the higher upfront
costs of some clean energy technologies. Today, almost 750 million people lack access
to electricity and 2 billion people lack access to clean cooking: significantly
accelerated action is needed to achieve universal energy access by 2030.

• Climate change and poor air quality entail severe risks to lives and livelihoods. In the
STEPS, the temperature rise reaches 2.4 °C by 2100 while in the NZE Scenario it peaks
at less than 1.6 °C and then falls to less than 1.5 °C in 2100. Action to reduce CO2
emissions to net zero as soon as possible and rapidly cut methane emissions is
essential to reduce climate change risks. Together with action on other pollutants,
this also brings dramatic improvements in air quality.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Boosting clean energy investment is vital for just, orderly and equitable transitions.
Clean energy investment rises from around USD 2 trillion today to nearly USD 3 trillion
in the STEPS in 2035 and to USD 5 trillion in the NZE Scenario.

Introduction

Each of our scenarios has different implications for security, affordability and sustainability.
These are the elements examined in detail in this chapter. The three objectives are rarely in
perfect alignment, and policy makers often face choices and trade-offs between them. But
neither are they necessarily in opposition to one another and there are many policy choices
that can simultaneously attain all three. What can be said with some confidence is that the
way policies are designed is key to striking a balance between these objectives.
Energy security is the focus of the first part of this chapter. Energy security means having
uninterrupted energy available at an affordable price. That in turn means ensuring reliable
sources of supply and designing and maintaining infrastructure and systems that are resilient
against physical and cyber threats. Alongside traditional risks to fuel security, issues could
arise during energy transitions, not least in the power sector, given increasing electricity
demand and a shift to more variable generation, and in clean energy supply chains, given
concerns about market concentration and an excessive reliance on a small number of
suppliers. Each scenario has some distinctive risks. The trajectories that we map may in some
ways understate the difficulties that lie ahead. Our scenarios depict smooth, orderly
processes, in which markets, investment, technologies and policies evolve in a consistent
way. This is not how the energy system operates in practice. The future is likely to be
characterised by competing interests, market imbalances, stop-and-go policies and bouts of
volatility and turbulence, just as the past has been.
People-centred aspects of energy transitions are the focus in the second section. Public
acceptance is a critical factor for the pace and consistency of energy transitions. In this
context, the impact of transitions on energy affordability, on jobs and livelihoods, and on the
ability to access energy services is particularly important. This section provides an overview
of how energy transitions are affecting people, and how they are affected by people’s
choices. It covers energy access and affordability, energy employment and changing
consumer behaviours, highlighting how these people-centred aspects look today, and how
they could evolve in the years ahead.
Efforts to tackle climate change is the focus of the third section. It details emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2) and methane associated with each scenario and looks at the extent to which
they could exacerbate climate change. In addition to the implications of each scenario for
the rise in global average temperatures, it considers the substantial variations in outcomes
for air quality and the consequent effects on public health.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The indispensable role of investment in safeguarding all the elements discussed in earlier
sections wraps up this chapter. It examines recent trends in capital flows to the energy
sector, looks at sources of investment and financing, and assesses their adequacy in relation
to the requirements of the scenarios.

Energy security

Energy security is a “foundational and central mission” for the International Energy Agency
(IEA), in the words of the communiqué adopted by ministers at the IEA 50th anniversary
meeting in 2024. The concept of energy security has evolved over the years since the IEA was
created in response to the first oil shock in the 1970s. Assessing energy security now requires
a comprehensive approach that encompasses not only traditional risks but also risks that
could emerge because of the impacts of climate change and the momentum behind clean
energy transitions.
The IEA response to recent turbulence in energy markets provides an illustration of the
multiple issues in play. In 2022, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the IEA
undertook the two largest-ever co-ordinated emergency oil stock releases in its history to
help prevent shortfalls in global supplies. At the same time, within days of the Russian
invasion, the IEA released a ten-point plan showing how the European Union could rapidly
reduce its reliance on natural gas supplies from Russia, including by accelerating deployment
of clean energy technologies.
Although the crisis had a very specific cause, it highlighted the general risk of excessive
reliance on a single source of energy from a single producer, and the benefits that diversity
can bring for energy security. With this principle in mind, the IEA has also been paying close
attention to the resilience and diversity of clean energy supply chains, including security risks
affecting the supply of critical minerals that are essential for many clean energy technologies.
Traditional risks to oil and gas security show few signs of abating and continue to be a central
preoccupation for the IEA, even as these risks evolve during energy transitions. As the world
moves towards a more renewables-rich energy system, some aspects of energy security will
improve, but new hazards are also emerging. For example, a more digitalised and electrified
world means that cybersecurity and electricity security have become critical concerns for
policy makers around the world.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Lasting energy security is not just about increasing the supply of power and fuels, and
ensuring that adequate and resilient infrastructure and systems are in place. It is also about
using energy more efficiently. Better materials and insulation, newer technologies and more
efficient appliances significantly reduce the energy needed to heat, cool and light our homes
and workplaces.
In addition, it is about minimising CO2 and methane emissions. It is sometimes claimed that
policy makers need to choose between energy security and climate action. There are indeed
some potential trade-offs, which we discuss in this section. But failure to act on emissions
increases the risks to energy security, not least because the physical consequences of a
changing climate pose a threat to the reliability of the global energy infrastructure and trade
flows. A comprehensive approach to energy security needs to include major reductions in
the energy-related emissions that are creating risks to energy supplies, as well as efforts to
make energy systems more climate resilient.

Adequacy of oil and gas supply and investment
The position of oil and natural gas markets today is very different from just a few years ago.
Before the Covid-19 pandemic, global spare crude oil production capacity, excluding Iran and
Russia, averaged less than 3 million barrels per day (mb/d); today it stands at close to 6 mb/d.
During the global energy crisis, after gas exports to Europe from Russia were cut, natural gas
markets were so tight that a 2022 explosion and fire at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal
in Texas with 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) capacity, close to 20% of US LNG capacity, caused
wholesale natural gas prices to jump in much of Europe by more than 10% and in the United
Kingdom by more than 20%. Although the European natural gas market remains fragile,
markets are now less tight, around 270 bcm of new LNG capacity is set to become available
in the next few years, increasing global available liquefaction capacity by close to 50% by
2030 (Figure 5.1).

Previous editions of the World Energy Outlook (WEO) warned of a risk of underinvestment
in oil and natural gas in a Stated Policies Scenario-like trajectory for demand, noting a gap
between the amounts being invested in oil and gas and the future requirements of this
scenario. This risk appears to have receded. Oil and gas investment has risen by around 30%
since 2021, while estimates of future investment have come down as projected oil and gas

demand levels have moderated. However, there is no room for complacency: unexpected
outages or other events could drastically change the supply-demand balance.
In the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) in this WEO, oil and natural gas demand both peak
before 2030 and decline slowly thereafter. Investment in both new and existing fields is
needed in the STEPS to avoid volatile markets and prices, but the level of investment in oil
and gas supply in 2024 (USD 860 billion) is around 20% more than what is invested in 2035
in this scenario. Increases in oil production in a number of non-OPEC producers, including
the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Guyana, push the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) share of the market down to around 33% in 2030, a level not
seen since the late 1980s. After 2030, the OPEC share of the oil market starts to rise again.
In the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario, oil
and natural gas demand peak earlier and then fall at a much faster rate. Investment in oil
and gas in the APS in 2035 amounts to some USD 490 billion, which is around 40% lower than
today, and in the NZE Scenario it is USD 250 billion, which is 70% lower. In these scenarios,
many new projects face major commercial risks, and some may fail to recover their upfront
costs. If all LNG projects under construction are developed, the global average utilisation
rates of LNG plants would fall from around 95% of capacity today to 75% by 2035 in the APS
and to less than 45% in the NZE Scenario, much lower than the 90% utilisation rate in the
STEPS.

Balancing investment in fossil fuels and clean energy

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There is sometimes a debate about whether the emphasis should be placed on demand-side
or supply-side actions in pushing forwards towards net zero emissions. In practice, rapid and
sustained progress towards net zero emissions depends on tackling both supply and demand
in an integrated way. In the APS and the NZE Scenario, reductions in fossil fuel investment
are synchronised with reductions in demand, notably through efficiency gains, and with rapid
scaling up of investment in clean energy. This approach offers the prospect of rapid progress
while minimising price volatility and security risks. For example, the nearly 75% reduction in
investment in fossil fuel production in the NZE Scenario between 2023 and 2035 is only
consistent with maintaining reliable energy supplies on the assumption of a 2.5-fold increase
in clean energy investment over the same period (Figure 5.2). This scenario requires policies
that focus both on scaling up the supply and demand of clean energy and on scaling back the
supply and demand of fossil fuels.
Policies and measures focussing on reducing fossil fuel demand and supply play a particularly
important role in ensuring that the energy transition is achieved in a just, orderly and
equitable way. Examples include policies that focus on the early retirement or conversion of
fossil fuel assets, such as coal-fired power plants or long-lived industrial facilities, or that
focus on providing clear signals to markets about the desired direction of travel, such as bans
on the sale of fossil fuel equipment. Inclusive dialogue between industry, labour,
communities and governments – including between producer and consumer countries – are
also essential to help inform coherent energy investment planning and to maximise
200

opportunities for socio-economic development from the transition. Supply-focussed fossil
fuel policies include those that reduce the emissions intensity of oil and gas supply or put in
place arrangements for the safe and responsible decommissioning of fossil fuel
infrastructure when it is no longer needed. These policies also have a part to play in avoiding
the unplanned, chaotic or premature retirement of existing fossil fuel infrastructure where
this could have negative consequences for the reliability of the overall system.

Resilient and reliable fuel supply chains and infrastructure
Ample spare crude oil capacity and the upcoming wave of new LNG supplies provide buffers
against the risk of sharp price shocks, but the security of fuel supplies is far from guaranteed,
not least because the effectiveness of this capacity to address any shortfalls that may arise
hinges on the ability of alternative sources of supply to reach an affected country or region
quickly. Without both resilient and reliable sources of energy and infrastructure to transport
supply to customers, local or regional disruptions remain a distinct possibility in the face of
risks from geopolitical tensions, technical failures and extreme weather events. These
impacts are likely to be felt more acutely in import-dependent countries. For example, for
importers in Asia – including Japan, Korea, and developing Asia – oil and gas import
dependency increases in aggregate in all scenarios, while the share of oil and gas in total
energy demand falls. In the STEPS, oil import dependency for these countries rises from 80%
today to close to 90% in 2050, and gas import dependency increases from 40% today to 60%

by 2050 (Figure 5.3). Petrochemical demand in Asia as a whole is one of the key drivers of oil
demand and imports (see Chapters 3 and 6).
The Middle East is the world’s largest oil exporter today and this remains the case in all
scenarios. It is also responsible for around one-third of the increase in LNG supplies in the
STEPS to 2035. The Middle East-Asia route is therefore set to remain an essential artery for
seaborne trade in oil and gas. As a result, consumers in Asia are exposed to the risk that
geopolitical events in the Middle East or accidents near major trade chokepoints could lead
to physical shortages of supply, as well as price volatility.

Oil and gas import dependency in Asia continues to rise,

Key maritime trade routes remain vital to the well-being of global oil and gas markets, but
they depend on safe passage through places such as the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of
Malacca. Today some 80% of crude oil imported into East Asian countries passes through the
Strait of Malacca, and more than half of it flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of
Malacca is mounting in importance, and oil and gas volumes flowing through it are set to
increase from 24 mb/d and 70 bcm today to 28 mb/d and 140 bcm in 2050 in the STEPS,
cementing its position as the largest chokepoint for global oil and LNG trade (Figure 5.4). The
complete closure of the Strait of Hormuz, while unlikely, would block off around 20 mb/d of
crude oil and oil products, or around 20% of global oil supply, together with the vast majority
of OPEC spare production capacity. Around 20% of global LNG trade also flows through the
Strait of Hormuz, and any action that blocked this would similarly be highly damaging for
natural gas markets.

202

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

For producer economies, energy transitions create a powerful incentive to accelerate the
pace of economic and energy sector reforms while at the same time reducing a major source
of revenue that could finance these reforms. Just ten established producer economies in the
Middle East, Africa and Latin America currently produce more than 30 mb/d of oil and nearly
800 bcm of natural gas annually, and their income from oil and gas sales in 2035 falls by 30%
in the APS and by 70% in the NZE Scenario from the average annual level seen between 2010
and 2023. The consequences of reductions in oil and gas revenue of the kind seen in these
scenarios would fall most heavily on producers, but they could affect consumers as well. If a
major producer were to struggle to withstand the strains placed on its fiscal balances, there
is a risk that this might at some point affect its political and economic stability, which could
in turn disrupt supplies and lead to higher and more volatile prices globally. The downward
spiral in Venezuela’s oil and gas sector in recent years illustrates that this is more than a
theoretical possibility.

The Middle East, a major fuel supplier to the global market, is particularly vulnerable to
climate events, underscoring its need for more climate resilient energy infrastructure
(Box 5.1). However, the increase in frequency and severity of climate hazards such as floods,
cyclones, droughts and extreme heat waves pose serious risks to energy infrastructure and
threaten reliable energy supplies in all parts of the world. For example, Hurricane Ida
temporarily disrupted 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico in the United States
in 2021 and shut down many oil refining and petrochemical facilities for weeks. In the same
Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

203

year, exceptionally cold weather in Texas shut down some natural gas and power supplies,
causing blackouts and hardship for consumers. There are also increasing risks from violent
storms that could impact LNG plants and refineries, which are often located in coastal areas,
and from water shortages in dry regions, which can disrupt fuel supply operations.
Box 5.1 ⊳

Climate resilience in the Middle East

The Middle East is facing a higher temperature rise than the global average, along with
more erratic precipitation patterns. Between 1980 and 2023, surface temperatures
across the Middle East increased by around 0.5 degrees Celsius (°C) per decade (IEA and
CMCC, 2024), well above the world average decadal increase over this period of around
0.2 °C (NOAA, 2024). Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, increasing
energy demand for cooling, while at the same time cutting the efficiency of power plants
and networks. For example, Kuwait saw widespread power cuts due to a heat wave in
June 2024.
The effects are not uniform across all countries in the Middle East. Changing precipitation
patterns have aggravated existing water scarcity in some countries and prompted floods
elsewhere. Countries near the Mediterranean Sea are having to cope with increasing
drought while Iran, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been
experiencing intense rainfall and flash flooding.
These impacts are set to intensify in the future. In the STEPS, the mean temperature in
2041-2060 in the region is around 2.8 °C higher than pre-industrial levels (and higher than
the global average increase of 2.1 °C in this scenario at that time) (IPCC, 2021). A mean
temperature at this level would lead to more than 90% of solar photovoltaic (PV), gasfired power plants and electricity networks in the Middle East experiencing an additional
20 days where temperatures exceed 35 °C, which would lead to a reduction in power
output and increase the chances of forced outages. In addition, around 80% of natural
gas power plants and oil refineries and 60% of oil-fired power plants in the region would
experience a more than 10% increase in one-day maximum precipitation levels, raising
the risk of forced outages and technical problems from flash flooding (Figure 5.5).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the light of the projected increase in climate impacts, countries in the region are
already pursuing measures to improve the resilience of their energy systems. This
includes technical and structural enhancements to energy infrastructure and the
development of digital technologies to enable operators to manage stresses and reduce
the risk of potential damage from extreme weather events. Crisis management and
contingency planning for climate-related disruptions also have a part to play, and so do
longer term strategies to diversify energy sources and invest in resources that can better
withstand extreme weather events.

Co-ordinated infrastructure planning in transitions

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Efforts to reduce unabated fossil fuel use and scale up clean energy need to be carefully
designed, which means, among other things, trying to map interdependencies and anticipate
possible feedback effects. For example, a mismatch between the rate of expansion of lowemissions electricity generation, networks and electrified end-user equipment on the one
hand and the decommissioning of natural gas-fired plants and gas networks on the other
could lead to energy security risks. It could also disproportionately affect consumers that are
unable to make the higher upfront investment often needed for electric end-use equipment.
Some existing infrastructure has a potentially important role to play in accelerating the
development of low-emissions fuels. Some of these fuels, including biomethane, lowemissions hydrogen-based fuels and some liquid biofuels, can make use of existing
infrastructure and end-use equipment. Delivery costs for others, including hydrogen, would
Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

205

be much lower if the existing infrastructure were to be adapted specifically for their use.
Such adaptation could help a number of countries that have the potential to be major
producers to export these fuels and could similarly help countries with limited domestic
resources to import them, and thus reduce their reliance on fossil fuel imports, diversify their
energy mix and reduce their emissions.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: km =kilometres; TWh = terawatt-hours.

The scale up of low-emissions hydrogen in the NZE Scenario offers an illustrative example. In
this scenario, around 400 million tonnes (Mt) of low-emissions hydrogen equivalent are
consumed globally in 2050. Around 20% of this is traded internationally, including hydrogen
converted into low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels. Low-emissions hydrogen is expensive
to transport, and repurposing existing pipelines could reduce investment costs by 50-80%
(IEA, 2022). Even if pipelines are repurposed in this way, new dedicated hydrogen transport
infrastructure is still needed. There are currently plans to develop around 37 000 kilometres
(km) of hydrogen pipelines globally by 2035, which is broadly in line with what is needed in
the NZE Scenario. However, most of these projects are at an early stage and only a handful
have reached final investment decisions, reflecting the generally slow pace of market
development. It is more challenging to convert existing storage for use with hydrogen, and
new facilities will be required, including depleted gas fields, hard rock caverns, salt caverns
and aquifers. Overall investment in hydrogen storage is currently very low and announced
projects cover only a small fraction of the needs in the NZE Scenario (Figure 5.6).

Electricity security

Adequacy and flexibility are both critical to the stability of electricity systems. Adequacy
focusses on ensuring that there is enough capacity and supply to meet peak demand, while
flexibility relates to the ability to handle variations in demand and renewable energy supply
and to maintain a continuous balance between electricity demand and supply. Ensuring that
electricity supply and demand are always in balance also requires secure and resilient
electricity networks.

Adequacy
Electricity demand increases in all regions and scenarios over the next ten years and changing
patterns of consumption have a significant impact on peak levels of demand. Anticipating
peak demand growth and mitigating it where possible is key to ensuring electricity security.
In the STEPS, peak demand rises by almost 15% in advanced economies to 2035, mainly
because more consumers use electric heating and electric vehicles (EVs), and by up to 80%
in emerging market and developing economies, most of which reflects increasing use of air
conditioners and other forms of space cooling. In the APS, peak demand grows by a similar
amount to the STEPS, as more electrification is compensated by higher energy efficiency
gains and stronger deployment of demand-side flexibility measures.

Energy efficiency measures can significantly reduce peak electricity demand. Minimum
energy performance standards for appliances, especially those used for cooling, improved
buildings insulation and more efficient industrial motors all serve to reduce total and peak
electricity demand. Demand-side flexibility measures can also bolster adequacy. In the
STEPS, efficiency and demand-side flexibility measures mean that peak demand rises by less
than 15% to 2035 in advanced economies: without these measures, peak demand would
increase by more than 40% (Figure 5.7). In the APS, the widespread deployment of smart
meters, dynamic tariffs and demand response-enabled appliances keeps peak demand in
2035 15% below the level it would otherwise reach in advanced economies. Peak demand is
similarly reduced by improved efficiency and demand-side flexibility in China and other
emerging market and developing economies, with efficiency gains playing an especially big
role (Box 5.2).
There are other strategies to mitigate the rise in peak demand. These include increasing the
capacity and number of interconnections, reinforcing existing grid infrastructure, developing
new grid lines and protecting them from cyberattacks and climate-related damage. In
addition to helping with the management of peak demand, these measures help reduce the
need to expand fossil fuel dispatchable power plants to provide system adequacy.
Nonetheless, the scale of the increases in peak electricity demand seen in all regions in both
the STEPS and APS means that new dispatchable capacity is required.
Battery storage is the fastest-growing source of short-term dispatchable capacity to 2035
across all scenarios. In advanced economies, almost 600 gigawatts (GW) of batteries are
added in the STEPS to 2035, and more than 850 GW are added in the APS; some new natural
gas power plants are also built in both scenarios, primarily to replace existing capacity. A
large amount of battery capacity is added in emerging market and developing economies,
but gas- and coal-fired power plants also continue to play an important role in these
economies.
Globally in the STEPS, batteries provide 55% of new dispatchable capacity, new natural gas
power plants provide 20% and new coal power plants add a further 10% to 2035 (Figure 5.8).
Around 50% of these coal capacity additions are in China, 20% in India and almost 10% in
Indonesia; more than 50% of the total are already under construction or in the pipeline. In
the APS, there is an even larger role for batteries, which provide more than half of
dispatchable capacity, and 500 MW of coal capacity additions are equipped with carbon
capture, utilisation and storage.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

There is also an important role for new nuclear plants, which provide 6% of the additional
capacity that becomes available in the STEPS: the majority of which is in emerging market
and developing economies, with 40% of it in China. In advanced economies, extending the
life of existing reactors where feasible remains the most economical way to maintain a stable
nuclear fleet that contributes to a secure and affordable supply of electricity.

Flexibility
Flexibility needs over both short-term and seasonal timeframes vary widely across regions,
largely due to differences in the share of renewables and in electrification rates. 1 In most
markets, dispatchable thermal and hydropower, including pumped storage, provided nearly
all short-term and seasonal power system flexibility in 2023, but this is set to change.
Short-term electricity flexibility needs, measured here as the largest hour-to-hour changes
in residual load (total electricity demand minus wind and solar PV generation), rise sharply
in the STEPS over the next ten years in many parts of the world, including Europe, China,
India and United States (Figure 5.9). In the period to 2050, they increase in these countries
by three- to seven-times more than total electricity demand, due mostly to rising shares of
solar PV and wind and, to a lesser degree, evolving patterns of electricity demand. For
example, short-term flexibility needs in Europe increase from 30 GW in 2023 to 170 GW to
2050 while average electricity demand increases from 360 GW to 610 GW.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Seasonal flexibility needs, measured as the highs and lows of residual load across the year,
are driven primarily by electricity demand patterns, though the seasonality of renewable
supply, notably wind and solar PV, also play a part. In Europe, seasonality is a feature of
power systems today, mostly due to high heating demand in winter, and seasonal flexibility
needs increase 50% faster than average electricity demand growth to 2035 in the STEPS as
1 Flexibility is defined as the ability of a power system to manage the variability of demand and supply, from

ensuring the instantaneous stability of the grid to balancing demand and supply in each hour in all seasons.

heating is increasingly electrified. In India, seasonal flexibility needs increase 30% faster than
average electricity demand growth during the same period, where electricity demand almost
doubles. Seasonal flexibility needs in India increase from a lower level than in Europe today,
primarily due to strong demand growth for cooling. In China, seasonal flexibility needs
increase 40% faster than average electricity demand growth to 2035 in the STEPS. In the
United States, seasonal flexibility needs move broadly in line with increases in electricity
demand. In the APS, more renewables and faster electrification increase the need for shortterm flexibility in all regions. Higher energy efficiency can temper the growth in the APS for
the needs for seasonal flexibility.

and indexed to the value in 2023.

Batteries and demand-side response are set to provide the majority of short-term power
system flexibility in both the STEPS and APS after 2035. Batteries provide short-term
flexibility for periods of one to eight hours, helping to improve grid stability and enabling the
rapid growth of solar PV by allowing electricity generated during the day to meet demand at
other times. In both the STEPS and APS, they provide around 30% of short-term flexibility
needs in 2035 and around 40% in 2050. Demand-side response also makes a major
contribution to flexibility even when it affects a relatively small fraction of overall demand
(Box 5.2).
210

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

The role of thermal power plants to provide short-term flexibility in power systems evolves
over time. Their share of the power mix declines but as short-term flexibility needs increase,
they are called on to adjust their output more often and over a wider range. Downward
ramping is needed during hours with high renewables output, for example in the middle of
the day when solar PV production is at its peak, and upward ramping is needed when residual
demand increases rapidly, for example at the end of the day when solar output declines. In
the STEPS, gas-fired power plants in Europe in 2050 operate below a 25% capacity factor for
most of the year, but they operate above 60% three-times as often as they do today
(Figure 5.10). This more responsive operating mode will require upgrades to the existing
dispatchable thermal fleet and measures to ensure that flexibility services are sufficiently
incentivised to ensure their economic viability (IEA, 2024a).

Seasonal flexibility needs are mostly provided by hydropower and thermal power plants to
2035. In the STEPS, these power sources cover 90% of seasonal needs in 2035 and 75% in
2050. The curtailment of some renewables output can also be part of a cost-effective
approach to handle seasonal variability in power systems, and when planned for, can also
help to reduce investment in other infrastructure such as electricity grids, storage and
electrolysers. There is scope for electrolysers to contribute in the future to seasonal flexibility
by using excess renewables generation to produce hydrogen that can be stored in long
duration storage facilities. Weather patterns can vary significantly from year to year,
influencing electricity demand through temperatures, and solar PV, wind generation and

flexibility needs, affect power plant operations and increase the variability of power system
costs (IEA, 2024a).
Box 5.2 ⊳

Harnessing the potential of demand response

Demand response – shifting the timing of electricity consumption from one part of the
day to another without changing the level of service to consumers – has a major role to
play in power system flexibility. In the STEPS, equipment that is responsible for around
one-quarter of electricity demand in Europe is likely to offer some flexibility potential by
2050. Most of it is set to come from EVs and heating systems, but industry is also well
suited to contribute to the provision of flexibility at times of peak demand, and hightemperature storage could enable longer shifting durations. In India, equipment
responsible for almost 20% of demand could be flexible, with fans and air conditioners
making a major contribution.

Notes: GW = gigawatts; IND = industry; BUI = buildings; TRA = transport. Flexibility is activated when

Our analysis for Europe and India finds that around 40% of the available flexibility would
be activated on average over the course of the year (Figure 5.11). Equipment that can
shift demand by the longest periods contributes the most, with more than half of
available flexibility in the transport and buildings sectors being activated. Activating
demand response helps reshape the overall demand curve: in Europe, for example, the
peak in electricity demand is shifted from the evening to the middle of the day when
212

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

renewables output is much larger. The widespread installation and use of smart meters,
smart thermostats and digitalised grids is essential to unlock the potential for flexibility
in all regions.
Demand response also frequently results in consumers paying less for the electricity they
consume and in reduced emissions. As the share of solar PV rises, it creates a regular and
predictable pattern of abundance during the day. In competitive markets, these periods
are likely to be characterised by low wholesale electricity prices which incentivise a shift
in consumption from periods when electricity prices are high to when they are lower.
These periods of lower prices often coincide with the times when electricity generation
produces lower than average emissions. Time-of-use tariffs are well suited for promoting
this structural demand response.
For less predictable and regular events, such as heat waves or prolonged periods of low
renewables output, more dynamic demand response measures are likely to be needed,
such as shifts in the timing of industrial operations. Measures of this kind may require
additional payment and may need to be triggered through some specific action rather
than relying on market signals. Dynamic tariffs and aggregator services are generally
effective ways of managing dynamic demand response, though they are likely to need to
be combined with appropriate measures to shield consumers from very high prices if they
are to command widespread public acceptance.

5.2.3

Security of clean energy supply chains and critical minerals

Clean energy manufacturing

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Expansion of manufacturing capacities for many clean energy technologies has far exceeded
the increase in clean energy technology deployment, contributing to the large drop in clean
energy technology prices in recent years. For example, annual capacity additions of solar PV
increased roughly fourfold between 2018 and 2023 from 100 GW to more than 420 GW while
annual manufacturing capacity expanded by a factor of six from around 200 GW to 1 150 GW.
Existing manufacturing capacity for solar PV modules and cells is almost sufficient to achieve
what is necessary to meet demand in the NZE Scenario in 2030, with only modest gaps
remaining for wafer and polysilicon manufacturing. For lithium-ion batteries, existing
manufacturing capacities and projects that have reached final investment decision are within
reach of the deployment needs in 2030 in the NZE Scenario, if fully utilised, even without
other early-stage projects that are in the pipeline. For wind, existing capacity and announced
projects would deliver just over 60% of 2030 deployment levels in the NZE Scenario
(IEA, 2024b).
Manufacturing capacities are highly concentrated geographically. Owing to its supportive
industrial policies, China has a very large proportion of existing manufacturing capacity for
solar PV, wind, heat pumps, electrolysers and battery components. In the case of batteries,
for example, China holds almost 90% of global capacity for battery cathode active materials,
Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

often a combination of lithium with nickel, cobalt and manganese, or iron phosphate, and
98% of capacity for battery anode active materials, frequently graphite or silicon-doped
graphite. While the project pipeline is expanding rapidly worldwide, a large portion of
planned projects are being developed in the regions where most capacity is already located,
with China accounting for around 90% of announced capacity additions for both cathodes
and anode active materials by 2030 (Figure 5.12). The overall level of geographic
concentration in manufacturing is therefore set to remain high, even if all announced
projects come to fruition.

Announced battery cell manufacturing projects will provide some diversification, but
battery component production is set to remain highly concentrated geographically
Note: 2030 value includes all operational capacity in 2023 together with the capacity of announced
manufacturing projects through to 2030.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The situation is somewhat different for battery cell manufacturing. The share of existing
manufacturing capacity in China is slightly lower than is the case for cathodes and anodes,
and planned capacity additions in Europe and the United States means this is likely to fall
further. In the European Union and the United States, announced battery cell manufacturing
capacity is sufficient to meet the 2030 domestic deployment needs associated with their
climate goals, provided that planned projects come online as scheduled (IEA, 2024c).
There are several barriers that hinder investment in new clean energy manufacturing
capacities outside China, the chief of which is a large production cost gap. IEA analysis of
more than 750 manufacturing facilities indicates that the capital and financing costs incurred
in building a clean energy manufacturing plant in the United States and Europe are typically
70-130% higher per unit of output capacity than those in China (Figure 5.13). Energy,
214

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

material, labour, and fixed operational expenditure can comprise 70-98% of the total costs
of building and operating solar PV, wind and battery manufacturing plants, and lower
operational costs in China amplify the cost differentials with advanced economies
(IEA, 2024d).

There are large cost gaps between regions when it comes to building and operating clean
technology manufacturing facilities, but non-cost factors also affect investment decisions

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Notes: kW = kilowatts; kWh = kilowatt-hours. Capital costs are shown per unit of annual rated capacity. Solar
PV includes polysilicon, wafer, cell and module production facilities. Batteries include cell, anode and cathode
production facilities. Wind includes nacelle, tower and blade facilities. Electrolysers include only the final
assembly step. Costs refer to greenfield, non-integrated facilities. No explicit policy incentives, e.g. tax credits,
are applied.

Financial incentives for manufacturing to help reduce these cost gaps are often provided in
the form of capital expenditure support, such as investment tax credits, grants, concessional
loans and loan guarantees, or operating cost support, such as production tax credits.
However, the challenges of investing in new manufacturing facilities are not limited to cost.
The size of the domestic market and its political stability, workforce, infrastructure readiness,
permitting processes, regulatory regimes and environmental, social and governance (ESG)
requirements all affect corporate investment decisions. Policy interventions can help raise
the attractiveness of investing by providing a high degree of policy stability, compressing
project lead times, strengthening training and certification schemes for workers, enlarging
domestic markets, reducing regulatory uncertainties and mandating higher ESG standards.
Measures to support innovation, including R&D grants and support for rapid prototyping,
can also make a difference.

Critical minerals
Critical mineral markets were turbulent in 2023, with a sharp drop in the price of many
materials. These lower prices have helped to bring about lower clean technology costs,
including a 14% reduction in battery pack costs in 2023 but they are now dampening the
investment appetite for new resource developments, with implications for future supply
diversification (BNEF, 2023). In the case of nickel, for example, three-quarters of operating
or potential projects that are at risk in today’s price environment are outside the top-three
producing countries. If they close because of low prices, supply will become further
concentrated among the largest suppliers.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Notes: Mt = million tonnes; Mt Li = million tonnes lithium content; kt = thousand tonnes. Graphite includes
spherical graphite and synthetic graphite. Primary supply requirements are total demand net of secondary
supply, which accounts for losses during refining operations. Base case includes production from existing
assets and those under construction, along with projects that have a high chance of moving forward. The high
production case, which exists only for copper, lithium, nickel and cobalt, includes projects that are less certain
but are at a reasonably advanced stage of development, or are seeking financing or permits.

A number of projects to develop new critical mineral mines and refineries have been
announced in recent years, but growth in the availability of critical minerals from the pipeline
of announced projects – many of which have significant lead times – is set to be slower than
expected growth in manufacturing capacity for a number of critical minerals. For example, in
the APS in 2035, for copper and lithium, there is a sizeable gap between demand and
expected supply based on announced projects (IEA, 2024e). Balances for nickel and cobalt
216

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

also look tight in terms of confirmed projects, but the outlook is better if projects at earlier
stages of development are included (Figure 5.14).
These results should not be interpreted to mean that energy transition goals are unattainable
due to material constraints. The gaps between future demand and anticipated supply could
be closed by developing additional mining and refining projects, more diversified technology
choices such as for battery chemistries or grid networks, promoting innovation, such as more
efficient battery pack design, and boosting recycling (IEA, 2024e). They do however highlight
risks to energy security based on current critical minerals investment and technology trends.
Further risks arise from the high degree of concentration of supplies of many critical minerals
within a few countries. Based on the pipeline of announced projects, this looks unlikely to
change over the next decade. From 2023 to 2035, some 50-75% of supply growth for refined
copper, lithium, and cobalt is projected to come from today’s largest producers, and the
same is true for about 90% of battery-grade graphite supply and nickel growth. The figures
for rare earth elements are lower, but these too face very high levels of market concentration
(Figure 5.15).

Notes: Shows base case supply scenario. Graphite includes battery-grade spherical graphite and synthetic
graphite; rare earth elements are for magnet rare earth elements only.

There are challenges in financing new critical mineral supply chains, including cost inflation,
long-term price uncertainty and the limited value that consumers currently place on
diversification. However, there is plenty of scope for demand-side actions such as recycling,
innovation and behavioural change, e.g. right sizing EV batteries, to play a role to ease

Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

217

potential supply strains. In the NZE Scenario, for example, demand for copper increases by
50% to 2040 but primary supply rises only by 30% because of increased recycling.
Incentivising products which score highly on ESG criteria can also help diversify supply
sources, but standards and regulatory interventions are likely to be needed to encourage the
widespread use of sustainably and responsibly produced materials. Subsidies or tax credits
are another option for supporting the production of responsibly sourced materials, for
example by linking eligibility to the procurement of a certain percentage of material supply
from responsibly and sustainably produced materials. Carbon accounting frameworks and
carbon pricing schemes could also help drive pricing differentiation between various sources
of materials, and disclosure policies such as those included in the European Union Battery
Regulation could make it easier for purchasers and consumers to determine the emissions of
different material sources.

5.3

Affordability and people-centred transitions

5.3.1

Energy bills

The 2022 global energy crisis provided a stark reminder of how much societies depend on
reliable and affordable supplies of energy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a huge increase
in wholesale energy prices, prompting governments worldwide to spend USD 940 billion to
support their populations by keeping energy more affordable. These interventions helped
limit the cost pass-through to retail energy prices but were insufficient to safeguard
households entirely, particularly those with low incomes. Worldwide, consumers spent on
average 20% more on energy in 2022 than in 2021, with the rising cost of energy outpacing
increases in disposable income over the same period. The situation began to improve in
2023, with declining wholesale energy prices, but the rollback of consumer affordability
support measures meant end-user energy prices remained relatively high in some regions.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In advanced economies, the poorest 10% of households can spend up to a quarter of their
disposable income on residential energy and transport fuels, even though they consume
about half as much of these fuels as the richest 10%. This level of expenditure means that
some households face difficult choices between heating or cooling their homes and meeting
other basic necessities. In 2022, almost one-in-ten people in the European Union – more than
40 million people – were unable to keep their homes adequately warm
(European Commission, 2023).
In emerging market and developing economies, modern energy use by households is on
average only one-third of that in advanced economies: the richest 10% of households in
emerging market and developing economies today consume about as much energy as the
poorest 10% in advanced economies. The disparities between income groups in emerging
market and developing economies is also wider than in advanced economies (Figure 5.16).
In these economies, the poorest consume around one-quarter of the energy consumed by

218

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

the richest. They are also heavily dependent on the traditional use of biomass, which meets
one-third of residential energy demand and is not included in expenditure metrics.

income for low-income households in certain countries in recent years. The traditional use of biomass, which
accounts for one-third of residential energy demand in emerging market and developing economies, is not
included in expenditure metrics.

Source: IEA (2024e).

Total household spendings on energy, including residential energy and transport fuels,
currently averages nearly USD 4 000 per year in advanced economies and around
USD 700 per year in emerging market and developing economies. In the NZE Scenario,
households in advanced economies soon start to see lower energy bills than in the STEPS
thanks to investment in improved insulation, more efficient heating and cooling systems,
behaviour changes and wholesale fossil fuel prices that have been driven lower by reduced
demand. Public support for household investment in clean energy equipment also reduces
direct household energy expenditure in the NZE Scenario. These savings also far outweigh
the increased cost borne by consumers in adopting higher efficiency and fuel switching
measures. In emerging market and developing economies, household energy expenditure is
initially higher in the NZE Scenario than in the STEPS as a result of increased access to modern

energy, reductions in fossil fuel subsidies and the introduction of CO2 pricing. Household
energy expenditure in the NZE Scenario nevertheless is around 25% lower than in the STEPS

Clean energy investment
IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Energy spending in advanced economies is lower in the NZE Scenario than in the STEPS;
it is higher in the near term in emerging market and developing economies, but soon falls
Notes: MER = market exchange rate. Clean energy investment is distributed across the economic lifetimes of
the assets, rather than being incurred as a full upfront investment.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Many clean energy technologies are already the most affordable options when life cycle costs
are considered. While their upfront costs in many cases are higher than those of their
conventional equivalents, they often have much lower operating costs because they are
more efficient. They also shield consumers from volatility in fossil fuel prices. However, the
higher upfront costs of many clean technologies compared with their conventional
counterparts is a significant barrier for low- and middle-income households. Addressing this
issue is crucial because the energy transition cannot succeed if the poorest segments of the
population are left behind. Potential measures include targeted subsidies for efficiency
upgrades and fuel switching, tax rebates and low- or zero-interest loans. Ensuring that these
households have access to affordable financing is especially important in emerging market
and developing economies where higher interest rates exacerbate the financial burden of
technologies with high capital costs.
An inequality that is sometimes given insufficient weight in today’s energy system is the
disparity between urban and rural households. Rural houses are often more isolated and
more expensive to connect to energy networks, and so they often face higher energy prices,

220

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

despite efforts by many governments to regulate electricity and natural gas prices so that
they are broadly the same for households in rural and urban areas.
In advanced economies, rural households spend around one-third more on energy than their
urban counterparts, and this expenditure represents a larger portion of their total
expenditure. Several factors contribute: rural households tend to be larger and less efficient
than those in urban areas, which drives up heating and cooling bills; they spend more on
transport fuels because they have to travel further to get to work and to access essential
services (they travel on average 35% further each year than urban households); and have
less access to public transport and so tend to own and use personal vehicles more frequently.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In emerging market and developing economies outside China, average energy bills for rural
households are almost half the average level of urban households, yet they account for a
very similar share of their total expenditure. Rural households tend to have more limited
access to modern energy services and so rely more on the traditional use of biomass. They
also tend to have lower incomes, lower levels of ownership of energy-consuming equipment,
and less access to developed transport infrastructure.
In China, rural and urban households on average spend similar amounts on energy, though
rural households devote a somewhat larger share of their budget on it. As in advanced
economies, rural households in China primarily use modern energy sources and tend to be
Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

221

larger and less efficient than urban ones. However, lower levels of ownership of energyconsuming equipment limit their total energy expenditure.
Because rural households in advanced economies tend to spend more on energy than urban
ones, they could potentially benefit more than urban households from the lower operating
costs of clean energy technologies. For example, the average payback period for an electric
car for rural households in advanced economies is under five years, compared with above six
years for urban households, and the average payback period for heat pumps is 13 years for
rural households, compared with ten years for urban ones (Figure 5.18). The availability of
public charging stations in rural areas remains a major hurdle, especially in regions where
long-distance driving is common. The clean energy technology proposition is less clear cut in
emerging market and developing economies, where access gaps and lower disposable
income lead to much lower levels of energy consumption in rural households.

5.3.2

Energy employment

Increasing clean energy investment has led to a steady increase in the number of people
working in the energy sector. In 2023, more than 67 million people were employed in the
energy industry worldwide, 4% more than in 2022, with most of the growth coming from
clean energy industries (Figure 5.19). In a number of major economies, clean energy has
been a prominent driver for new economy-wide employment, for example contributing as
much as 10% of overall job growth in China in 2023.
A few key technologies are responsible for most of the new jobs. EV manufacturing and their
batteries saw some of the biggest gains in employment: 0.4 million jobs were added in 2023,
raising the global total to 2.7 million. Nearly three-quarters of the global EV and EV battery
workforce in 2023 was located in China, with employers benefitting from new energy vehicle
manufacturing incentives from the government. About one-fifth of the global EV and battery
workforce was in the United States and the European Union, which both have large existing
vehicle manufacturing capacities and have recently implemented policies that aim to boost
domestic EV manufacturing. Solar PV and wind energy also saw substantial employment
growth in 2023: they now account for a combined 6.2 million workers worldwide, most of
which work in construction and installation.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The share of clean energy in economy-wide employment growth in most emerging market
and developing economies outside China has been more muted than in advanced economies.
This is partly because the non-energy economy of these countries has been growing rapidly,
but also because they have seen much lower levels of clean energy investment than
advanced economies and China. The largest share of clean energy jobs today is in the
construction and installation of new energy projects, followed by jobs in operation. But in
emerging market and developing economies, these roles tend to pay less than comparable
jobs in advanced economies, even when adjusted for purchasing power parity.

Clean energy job additions accounted for a substantial share of economy-wide
job growth in China, United States, European Union and Japan

Lower labour costs in emerging market and developing economies should be an advantage
to attract new clean energy industries. However, most new clean technology manufacturing
facilities to date have been concentrated in China, advanced economies and Southeast Asia.
Growth in clean energy manufacturing employment has been particularly slow in Africa and
Central and South America. This may reflect concerns on the part of prospective investors
about relatively small domestic and regional markets for deployment, ample global
manufacturing capacity for many clean technologies, and a relative absence of relevant
adjacent industries and skills that are often a strong draw for clean energy manufacturers
siting new facilities.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the STEPS, more than 6 million new energy workers are needed worldwide by 2030. This
figure rises to 15 million in the NZE Scenario. EVs and EV batteries see the largest gains to
2030, with the number of jobs in the STEPS increasing from 2.7 million today to 6.7 million
in 2030. In the NZE Scenario, this rises to 10.5 million (Figure 5.20).
Job losses are associated with declining production and consumption of fossil fuels in each
scenario. The global coal mining workforce has been shrinking for more than a decade, led
by the push to modernise the mining industry in China, and this is set to continue in the years
ahead. By 2030, the number of coal supply jobs worldwide falls by over 20% in the STEPS and
by 50% in the NZE Scenario. The number of oil and natural gas supply jobs rises by almost
300 000 in the STEPS but falls by nearly 5 million jobs in the NZE Scenario to 2030. Many oil
and gas companies, especially in advanced economies, are turning to contract work to
manage short-term increases in worker demand while adopting strategies of portfolio
diversification and upskilling to hedge against uncertainty in future demand.

Energy transitions in all scenarios are a net creator of direct jobs as decreases in fuel supply
jobs are more than offset by increases in low-emissions power and end-use sectors
Note: ICE = internal combustion engine; HVAC = heating, ventilation and air conditioning.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The impact of these losses on individuals and communities can be huge. In some cases,
workers may be able to find alternative work in other energy sectors. But even those workers
that are best placed to make this switch, such as highly skilled oil and gas workers, face
challenges: new jobs may not be located in or near the places where they currently work or
offer the same benefits and remuneration as their previous occupation. In many other cases,
the skills of energy workers may not neatly align with other energy jobs that are created.
Coal workers may face particular challenges on this front. Co-ordination between
government, labour unions and industry is critical to ensure that all workers that lose their
jobs are able to access financial support and skills training and to promote the provision of
alternative opportunities.
Several parts of the energy industry are facing skill shortages today. This poses a risk to clean
energy transitions. Many clean energy sectors compete for the same limited pool of trade
workers, including construction workers, welders and electricians, and those with the
necessary skills are in many cases already in short supply in the general buildings sector.
Some skilled workers may move into clean energy from sectors such as oil and gas, nuclear
and hydropower, but these sectors are also facing skills losses as older workers retire.
Notable shortages have also emerged in recent years in manufacturing and transport.
Employers are using a range of strategies to cope with the lack of skilled labour. Options
224

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

include raising wages, adopting automation, increasing on-the-job training, and in some
cases, accepting insufficiently skilled candidates for critical roles.
The new clean energy economy offers substantial opportunities to stimulate local economies
and improve the quality of life for workers. But capturing these benefits and preventing the
skills gap from widening further requires both the public and private sectors to invest in
education and training. Collaboration has an important part to play in getting the most from
such investment. For example, closer partnerships between educational institutions and
industry would help improve up-to-date curricula for future energy workers. Policies such as
the European Skills Agenda and the US Inflation Reduction Act are looking to address these
issues, but current efforts in these regions and elsewhere most likely need to be
supplemented to prevent a shortage of skilled workers from becoming a bottleneck for the
energy transition.

5.3.3

Energy access

The Covid-19 pandemic and global energy crisis setback efforts to expand electricity access.
For the first time in decades, the number of people worldwide without access to electricity
increased in 2022. The effects were felt most acutely in sub-Saharan Africa, where the
number of people without electricity access increased by around 15 million between 2019
and 2022.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In 2023, the number of people worldwide without electricity access started to fall again,
decreasing by around 13 million despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Accelerated
grid connections were the main driver of renewed progress in Nigeria, Rwanda, Uganda,
Senegal and Ethiopia. This was enabled by strong government support and affordability
programmes such as the Hybrid Connection Programme in Uganda. There were also
improvements in developing Asia, with Cambodia, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Philippines
witnessing a large reduction in the number of people without access to electricity.
Bangladesh achieved universal access in 2023. Solar home systems saw record sales for the
second year in a row in 2023, with strong uptake in West Africa, even though there was an
increasing share of grid-connected households in developing Asia (GOGLA, 2024). Despite
this progress, however, almost 750 million people still have no access to electricity around
the world, 80% of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.
Progress to achieve universal access to clean cooking also slowed in the 2019-2022 period in
many countries. Increased strains on household incomes and rising energy prices hindered
progress. Plus, millions of households that had previously gained access reverted, at least
temporarily, to traditional cooking fuels. Recent gains have come from well-established,
funded and targeted clean cooking policies, which were generally resilient even through the
Covid-19 pandemic. Several notable programmes in China and India over the past ten years
provided access to clean cookstoves to tens of millions of households. However, progress in
sub-Saharan Africa has been slow, and the number of people without access to clean cooking
continues to rise, with damaging effects on health and livelihoods, particularly for women

New policies are set to facilitate access to clean cooking solutions. Around 630 million people
without access today live in countries where new and improved government initiatives and
regulatory frameworks have been introduced in the past couple of years (Figure 5.21). This
includes new national clean cooking plans in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, São Tomé and
Príncipe, and Uganda. Tanzania has plans to reduce import duties for clean cooking stoves
and fuels and increase investment in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage. Madagascar
started working on its Integrated Energy Access Plan. There is renewed policy momentum in
India with the launch of the National Efficient Cooking Programme. In Pakistan, a national
clean cooking strategy is being developed in line with the 2023 National Clean Air Policy. The
governments of Kenya, Rwanda and Sierra Leone have established clean cooking delivery
units. Several other sub-Saharan countries are considering similar initiatives. At the Summit
2 This is a downward revision from the WEO-2023, which indicated that around 2.3 billion people did not have

access to clean cooking in 2022, as new data indicate that access in China, India and Indonesia has been
improving faster than previously known.

on Clean Cooking in Africa, co-hosted by the IEA in May 2024, more than USD 2.2 billion of
new funding was committed for clean cooking initiatives in Africa, plus several other positive
developments in policy, financing and partnerships.
Around 90% of both the population without access to electricity and clean cooking today live
in countries that have official targets to improve access, though only around half live in
countries with targets aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 7.1, with its objective to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and
modern energy services by 2030. In the STEPS, around 645 million people still lack access to
electricity in 2030, and 1.7 billion lack access to clean cooking (Figure 5.22). This is a slight
improvement over the STEPS in the WEO-2023, but it still falls well short of the SDG 7.1 goal.
In the APS, where all official targets are met on time and in full, around 280 million people
still lack electricity access in 2030, and the equivalent figure for clean cooking is around
745 million. In the NZE Scenario, universal access to electricity and clean cooking is achieved
in full by 2030. In total, reaching universal access worldwide requires around USD 55 billion
of capital investment each year through to 2030, of which around USD 10 billion annually is
for clean cooking. Public and concessional finance has a crucial role to improve affordability
and reduce perceived risks for private investors through programmes and initiatives such as
the World Bank and African Development Bank commitment to provide 300 million people
in Africa with access to electricity by 2030 (World Bank, 2024).

Behavioural change

Behavioural changes by consumers to reduce energy use are an under-employed lever for
reaching energy security and climate goals. Behavioural change can help limit growth in
energy demand and thus curb emissions, especially in sectors where technical alternatives
are scarce or costly. Around 25 countries include behavioural measures in their Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs) or long-term strategies. Most behavioural measures relate
to transport. For example, many European countries aim to reduce the use of private cars
through measures such as road space allocation schemes, low-emissions zones and
investment in public transport infrastructure and cycle lanes. Bangladesh and Türkiye include
targets for modal shifts from road transport to rail, while Colombia and Austria have set
targets for bicycle use.
Measures in NDCs and other climate strategies are incorporated into the APS, and they
account for less than 1% of the difference in emissions between the APS and the STEPS in
2035. This relatively small share reflects a perception by policy makers that measures to
encourage behavioural change are unpopular. However, there is mounting evidence that it
is possible to win public support for effective policies. For example, support for congestion
charging in Stockholm, London and elsewhere increased significantly in the years following
its introduction as parallel improvements were made in public transport and as citizens
increasingly realised the benefits of reduced congestion and air pollution. Discretionary
changes, such as reducing thermostat settings, were made by many people during the global
energy crisis in 2022, in part in response to public awareness campaigns. In addition, many
people that worked from home during the Covid-19 pandemic continue to do so, thereby
reducing commutes.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The NZE Scenario taps the full potential for behavioural change to reduce emissions
(Figure 5.23). In total, around 5% of the difference in emissions reductions between the
STEPS and the NZE Scenario in 2035 stem from behavioural change. On a per capita basis,
CO2 reductions from behaviour change are more than four-times larger in advanced
economies than in emerging market and developing economies. Measures to reduce car use
in cities and promote shared mobility are adopted widely, which reduces CO2 emissions by
around 300 Mt globally in 2035. Moderating space heating and cooling in buildings where
this is feasible saves about 150 Mt and introducing a levy on frequent flying cuts emissions
by a further 80 Mt in 2035.
Two-thirds of the emissions reductions in the NZE Scenario from behavioural change are
facilitated or mandated by governments, such as congestion charging or reduced speed limits
on roads. Around 40% of the behavioural measures adopted require investment in dedicated
infrastructure, such as cycle lanes or high-speed rail networks (Box 5.3). The remaining
one-third of emissions reductions are mainly from discretionary changes, half of which
revolve around energy saving measures in homes that can be encouraged by information
and awareness campaigns in conjunction with home energy consumption reports.

mobility measures include ride sharing services and carpooling. Other fuel efficiency measures include
eco-driving and air conditioning measures. Industry measures include reuse, recycling and vehicle activity
reduction. Reduced flying includes shifts to high-speed rail, frequent-flyer levies and replacing long-haul flights
for business trips with teleconferencing.

Box 5.3 ⊳

How infrastructure shapes transport choices

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Emissions associated with moving around cities vary widely depending on the local
transport infrastructure, the services available and the density of the built environment.
In many cities, there is limited scope for walking, a lack of cycling and public transport
infrastructure and locked-in car dependency for services, which leads to elevated levels
of emissions from travel and poor air quality. Zoning laws that prioritise low-rise, singleuse developments can exacerbate this trend by increasing travel times to essential
services.
Major changes in transport behaviour are possible with the right policies, infrastructure
and services (Figure 5.24). For example, in Paris, the share of journeys accounted for by
private car travel fell from 65% in the late 1980s to 15% in 2023 as a result of measures
to discourage car use, such as road space reallocation and parking restrictions,
investment in public transport, and a major increase in support for cycling infrastructure.
In Santiago, the figure fell from 34% in 2001 to 28% in 2012 following significant
investment in the development of cycle paths in the late 2000s. There are also many
examples where a lack of policy and support for walking, cycling and public transport has
led to very high and increasing dependency on private transport. In Jakarta, for example,

Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

229

only 7% of roads have adjacent pedestrian walkways and the number of journeys
involving private transport rose from 38% of the total in 2002 to 88% in 2020. In Los
Angeles, where 93% of transport is private, the average person spends more than
100 hours in traffic jams every year, and a one-kilometre journey produces almost
six-times more CO2 emissions on average than a journey of the same length in
Amsterdam.

Broader awareness and higher investment are needed to support active and public
transport options for rural communities. In England, for example, rural residents using
public transport spend twice as long commuting to reach essential services as urban
residents do, while those using private cars experience only a minor increase in travel
times. Across northwest Europe, car ownership rates for rural residents are 65% higher
than for urban residents. Options that would help address the “last mile” challenge of
connecting residents to regional transport corridors include local and regional authority
support for rural mobility hubs, smart and affordable ticketing solutions, investment in
public minibus services, and cycling infrastructure that can be used for small battery
electric powered transport like electric bikes, scooters and two/three-wheelers. Without
measures of this kind, the majority of energy use reductions from active and public transit
options will remain concentrated in cities.

Emissions trajectories and temperature outcomes

Energy-related CO2 emissions increased by just over 1% in 2023 to a record high of
37.7 gigatonnes (Gt). In the STEPS, CO2 emissions reach just over 38 Gt in the mid‐2020s and
then fall to less than 29 Gt in 2050. Around 60% of the decline in emissions to 2050 occurs in
advanced economies, mainly due to declining emissions from electricity generation and
transport. Emissions in emerging market and developing economies fall more slowly, with
reductions in emissions from electricity generation partially offset by increases in road
transport and industry (Figure 5.25).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the APS, global CO2 emissions fall to around 32 Gt in 2030 and 12 Gt in 2050. Advanced
economies collectively reduce their emissions to close to zero in 2050. The pace of emissions
reductions in emerging market and developing economies accelerates in the early 2030s, but
they still emit around 10 Gt CO2 in 2050.
In the NZE Scenario, global CO2 emissions decline to around 25 Gt in 2030, a 33% reduction
from 2023 levels, and to net zero in 2050. Net zero electricity sector emissions are achieved
in aggregate around 2035 in advanced economies and in 2045 in emerging market and
developing economies. Advanced economies achieve net zero emissions in aggregate by the
mid-2040s, and they collectively remove around 0.9 Gt CO2 from the atmosphere via carbon

removal technologies in 2050. China reaches net zero emissions around 2050 and other
emerging market and developing economies only well after 2050.
Various pathways for future CO2 emissions lead to very different temperature outcomes
(Figure 5.26). In the STEPS, the global average long-term temperature rise, which currently
stands at around 1.3 °C above pre-industrial levels, exceeds 1.9 °C around 2050 and reaches
2.4 °C in 2100. 3 The lower levels of future emissions in the APS lead to a global average
surface temperature rise of around 1.7 °C in 2100. The NZE Scenario sees a peak temperature
rise of less than 1.6 °C around 2040 before falling back to below 1.5 °C by 2100. Because of
uncertainties about the physical response of the climate to future emissions and warming,
higher (and lower) temperature outcomes cannot be ruled out. For example, in the STEPS
there is about a one-third chance of a temperature rise above 2.6 °C in 2100, and in the
NZE Scenario there is about one-third chance of the temperature rise remaining above 1.6 °C
in 2100.

3 Temperature rises here are median estimates, meaning there is a 50% chance of remaining below the stated
level. All changes in temperatures are relative to 1850‐1900 and match the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) definition of warming of 0.85 °C between 1995‐2014
(IPCC, 2023).

232

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

These levels of warming refer to the long-term average temperature rise. Short-term climate
variability arising from natural cycles – such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation – can raise or
lower global temperatures by up to 0.2 °C and so the temperature rise in any given month or
year can be higher or lower than the long-term average trend. Several estimates of the global
average temperature rise during the 12-month period from July 2023 to June 2024 exceed
1.5 °C. However, the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are generally interpreted as
long-term warming levels. 4 Even if the global temperature exceeds 1.5 °C for a short period,
the temperature can fall back from that level in the long term. Every tenth of a degree
matters, and countries around the world need to bring emissions down to net zero as soon
as possible to avoid the worst impacts of climate change (Box 5.4).
Box 5.4 ⊳

Impacts of climate change on energy demand and supply

Climate change is already having pronounced impacts. For the energy sector, these
include reducing the effective capacity of power plants, increasing transmission losses,
increasing energy demand for cooling and decreasing energy demand for heating.
Extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent because of climate change,
also have major implications for energy use. In 2023, for example, around
800 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity was used for cooling during extreme heat events,
up from less than 300 TWh in the 1990s.
The total cost of meeting cooling demand during extreme heat events has risen from just
over USD 10 billion each year in the 1990s to nearly USD 30 billion a year in the last
decade (Figure 5.27). Just over one-quarter of this increase stems from the increasing
number of extreme heat events experienced around the world, while the rest is
attributable to the increasing uptake and use of air conditioning. The figures cover only
energy costs and so do not reflect all the costs incurred by electricity grids to expand
generation and deliver power. Globally, decreased demand for heating has offset some
of the increased demand for cooling, but meeting the rise in cooling demand during peak
times will likely result in higher system costs in the future.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Hydropower faces declining output in many parts of the world, in large part due to
climate change-induced shifts in precipitation patterns, increased variabilities in runoff,
and physical damage to dams caused by extreme weather events. These factors have
contributed to the decrease of hydropower capacity factor from 44% in the 1990s to 41%
in the 2020s (IEA, 2024f). This implies a loss of around 330 TWh of annual power
generation today, which is broadly equal to the amount of generation from all new solar
PV added worldwide in 2023. Compensating for the loss of generation resulting from the
derating of hydropower, including pumped storage, is estimated to have cost around
USD 18 billion each year over the last ten years.

4 The IPCC AR6 bases the long-term temperature rise on the midpoint of a twenty-year period (IPCC, 2023).

Annual climate-related costs from lower hydropower output and higher cooling
demand have already risen by around USD 30 billion since the1990s

These costs underestimate the full costs caused by climate change to electricity systems.
Extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, droughts and storms have led to
damage to all types of energy infrastructure and to power outages and disruption of
energy supply chains, causing temporary price surges and lost economic output. Costs
are expected to rise, especially in scenarios with higher temperature outcomes.

5.4.2

Methane abatement

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Methane is responsible for around 30% of the long-term rise in global temperature, and rapid
and sustained reductions in methane emissions are essential to reduce near-term global
warming. The fossil fuel sector is responsible for nearly 120 million tonnes (Mt) of methane
emissions each year, or around one-third of total methane emissions from human activities,
and there is scope for immediate and low-cost reductions. The IEA estimates that around
two-thirds of methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided through the deployment
of known and readily available technologies, often at low – or even negative – cost, and an
emissions price of USD 20/tonne CO2-equivalent would be enough to make it cost effective
to deploy nearly all measures to abate fossil fuel methane emissions.
There is mounting momentum for action on methane. Some 157 countries, which together
are responsible for around half of global human-caused methane emissions, have signed the
Global Methane Pledge, committing them to a collective effort to reduce global methane
emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. A group of 54 oil and gas companies
have joined the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter, an industry initiative committed to
234

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

reducing upstream methane emissions to near zero by 2030. We estimate that achieving all
methane pledges made by countries and companies would cut emissions from fossil fuels by
50% by 2030. However, many pledges are not backed by detailed implementation plans, and
several major emitters have not committed to act on methane, including Russia and India.
Methane emissions from fossil fuel operations fall in each scenario from 2023 to 2030. In the
STEPS, they decline by around 25%, in the APS by 50%, and in the NZE Scenario by 75%. In
the STEPS, reductions take place where cost-effective abatement options exist or where
policy requirements are in place, for example, in the United States and the European Union.
In the APS, pledges to tackle methane, including through the Global Methane Pledge, other
climate commitments, and company efforts to deliver near zero methane emissions targets
are assumed to be achieved in full. As a result, methane emissions from oil and gas drop 55%
by 2030 and emissions from coal drop almost 40% by then. In the NZE Scenario, all fossil fuel
producers reduce their methane emission intensities by 2030 to the levels being achieved
today by the world’s best operators: the methane emissions intensity of oil and gas
operations falls from 1.3% today to less than 0.1% in 2050 and the intensity of coal
operations falls from 1.2% today to 0.6% (Figure 5.28).

New technology and tools for tracking emissions, including satellites and other remote

transparency on emissions and facilitate regulatory oversight. It would also provide useful

climate credentials. Low- and middle-income countries may require technical assistance or
support to identify abatement opportunities, obtain financing and develop regulations.
There is increasing interest in some countries in tackling methane emissions from fossil fuel
imports (Figure 5.29). In advanced economies, methane emissions arising from the
production of oil and gas that they import amount to around 15 Mt annually, which is similar
to the level of emissions that occur within their borders from domestic production and local
distribution. The European Union Methane Regulation, adopted in May 2024, requires
natural gas, oil and coal imported into the European Union under contracts concluded after
January 2027 to meet reporting requirements equivalent to those for domestic sources. It
also references a methane intensity standard for new contracts as from 2030.

Harmonised measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification standards can bolster

are many examples of current initiatives, including: the United Nations Environment
Programme Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (UNEP, 2024); the Coalition for LNG

Air pollution and public health

Exposure to air pollution causes more than 17 000 premature deaths every day, making it
deadlier than smoking or obesity. 5 In 2023 nearly 3 million people died prematurely from
household air pollution, while ambient (outdoor) air pollution was responsible for more than
4.5 million deaths. The worst consequences of air pollution are felt in emerging market and
developing economies: more than 99% of people exposed to heavily polluted air live in these
economies, and more than 90% of premature deaths occur there. 6 The economic costs of air
pollution associated with productivity losses and direct healthcare costs exceeds 10% of
gross domestic product in some developing economies. Air pollution also harms ecosystems,
for example by making forests less resistant to disease, and by polluting lakes and rivers via
acid rain.

as a result of increased use of clean cooking fuels and reduced reliance on solid biomass for
heating, but this is in part offset by more industry activity and the increased use of bioenergy
and waste for industrial heat, especially in emerging market and developing economies. In
total, around 2.5 million more people die annually from ambient air pollution in 2050 than
today. Annual premature deaths from household air pollution drop by almost 40% to 2050,
with large reductions in some parts of the world – in China these deaths are all but eliminated
by 2050 – but there are increases elsewhere, including in Africa, as a result of population
growth and a failure to achieve universal access to modern energy services. In total,
household and ambient air pollution causes around 190 million premature deaths to 2050 in
the STEPS, just under 95% of which are in emerging market and developing economies.
In the APS, there is a 30% reduction in PM2.5 emissions between 2023 and 2050, mainly from
a reduction in the use of biomass and waste for cooking and from a reduction in coal use in
electricity generation and oil use in road transport. Nonetheless, population growth and
urbanisation mean that there is still a 40% increase in annual premature deaths from
ambient air pollution between 2023 and 2050. Annual premature deaths from household air
pollution decline by 70% to 2050, mainly as a result of pledges on clean cooking access in
sub-Saharan Africa. In total, around 160 million people die prematurely from air pollution
between 2023 and 2050 in the APS.
In the NZE Scenario, the number of people exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5 emissions
declines dramatically from current levels. Emissions from electricity generation are almost
entirely eliminated by 2050 as fossil fuel use declines, emissions from transport are cut by
85% to 2050 as EVs rapidly gain ground, and emissions from industry are cut by 75% as input
fuels become cleaner. This results in around 1.5 million fewer premature deaths from
ambient air pollution in 2050 than in 2023. Achieving universal access to clean cooking by
2030 cuts exposure to household air pollution, resulting in around 2.4 million fewer
premature deaths in 2050. In total, around 110 million fewer people die prematurely from
air pollution between 2023 and 2050 in the NZE Scenario than in the STEPS, and around
80 million fewer than in the APS.

Investment and finance

5.5.1

Energy investment

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global energy investment is expected to surpass USD 3 trillion for the first time in 2024.
About USD 2 trillion is set to be spent on clean energy technologies and infrastructure and
USD 1 trillion on fossil fuel supply and power generation. This picture is markedly different
from ten years ago: total energy investment was then around USD 2.8 trillion, with about
60% spent on fossil fuels and only 40% on clean energy. Since 2015, investment in fossil fuels
has declined by more than 30% while spending on clean energy increased by almost 70%.
Around USD 860 billion is set to be invested in oil and gas supply in 2024, which is about 20%
more than what is invested in 2035 in the STEPS. Around USD 165 billion is set to be spent
on coal in 2024, which is more than twice the level seen in the STEPS in 2035. In the APS,
238

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

investment in existing and some new oil and gas fields is necessary, but there is no need in
aggregate for new exploration. In the NZE Scenario, declines in demand are sufficiently steep
that no new long lead-time conventional oil and gas projects are required, and no new coal
mines or coal mine lifetime extensions are needed either. As a result, fossil fuel investment
in the NZE Scenario falls by more than 75% to 2035.
Clean energy investment increases in each scenario. In the STEPS, more than 75% of total
energy investment of USD 3.5 trillion is directed towards clean energy by 2035; in the APS,
clean energy comprises close to 90% of USD 4.5 trillion of energy investment by 2035; in the
NZE Scenario, clean energy accounts for more than 95% of investment totalling
USD 5.2 trillion (Figure 5.31). Investment in low-emissions power generation and grid
infrastructure rises rapidly in the next few years, and the transport sector attracts more enduse investment than any other sector by 2035 in all scenarios, driven by the adoption of EVs
and the necessary investment in support infrastructure.

For every USD 1 invested in fossil fuels today, around USD 2 is invested in clean energy. By
2035, this rises to USD 3 in the STEPS in 2035, USD 7 in the APS, and USD 20 in the NZE Scenario.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: MER = market exchange rate; 2024e = estimated value for 2024.

Nearly 85% of total clean energy investment in 2024 takes place in advanced economies and
China even though they are home to only 35% of the world’s population. The high cost of
capital remains a major barrier to investing in clean energy projects and infrastructure in
many emerging market and developing economies. Financing costs for a typical utility-scale
solar PV project are at least twice as high in emerging market and developing economies as
in advanced economies and in China. This mainly reflects weak macroeconomic conditions
and country-specific circumstances in many emerging market and developing countries, but

the lack of available local currency domestic lending pools and the high cost of currency derisking tools are also factors.
Advanced economies and China increase their clean energy investment by more than 30% to
2035 in the STEPS, by 60-80% in the APS and by 70-100% in the NZE Scenario. Clean energy
investment in other emerging market and developing economies doubles in the STEPS,
triples in the APS and rises by a factor of six in the NZE Scenario over this period (Figure 5.32).
In the NZE Scenario, 40% of clean energy investment globally occurs in these regions in 2035,
up from 15% today.

Most investment in emerging market and developing economies is still devoted to fossil
fuels and the high cost of capital remains a major barrier to investing in clean energy

Investment in the power sector

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Global investment in the power sector is expected to reach more than USD 1.3 trillion in
2024, most of which is for low-emissions power assets such as renewables, nuclear power,
grids and battery storage. Despite concerns over high interest rates and the profitability of
renewables firms, this represents an increase of 8% over total low-emissions power
investment in 2023. By 2035, investment in low-emissions power accounts for almost all
power sector investment in the STEPS and the APS, and it rises in these scenarios to
USD 1.7 trillion and USD 2.2 trillion respectively.
The level of investment is higher still in the NZE Scenario. Achieving the goal of tripling
installed renewables capacity by 2030, as in this scenario, requires doubling current
investment levels in renewable power, grids and battery storage to USD 2.5 trillion by 2030.
This rises further to USD 2.7 trillion by 2035 as the world rapidly electrifies large parts of the
240

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

global economy to meet climate and energy access goals and as demand rises rapidly in
emerging market and developing economies.
Across all scenarios, power sector investment peaks around 2035 and declines afterwards as
costs for renewable power and battery storage continue to decrease and as the number of
new renewable capacity installations falls slightly from the mid-2030s once power systems
are fully decarbonised (Figure 5.33). The reduction is particularly pronounced in the
NZE Scenario because renewable power costs decline faster than in the other scenarios in
response to the strength of the initial ramp up in capacity installations in this scenario. To
enable this rollout of renewable power, spending on grids and battery storage doubles from
around USD 0.6 per dollar invested in 2023 to USD 1.2 per dollar invested in 2050 in all
scenarios.

Power sector investment doubles by 2035 in the NZE Scenario,
driven by the need for rapid growth in renewables, grids and battery storage

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The European Union Green Deal helped drive a 70% increase in spending on clean power in
Europe between 2019 and 2024 and the United States Inflation Reduction Act led to a 60%
rise in the United States over the same period. China has also seen a major increase in clean
power investment, doubling its spending on renewable power, nuclear power, grids and
batteries over the past five years. In the NZE Scenario, clean power investment increases
from USD 560 billion in 2024 to more than a trillion in 2035 in advanced economies, and from
USD 450 billion to USD 650 billion in China.
Today around 20% of clean power investment globally is in emerging market and developing
economies other than China. In the NZE Scenario, there is a more than a fourfold increase in
clean power investment in these countries, and their share of the global total rises to 40%
by 2035. Lowering their cost of capital is vital to stimulate investment. This requires a
combination of clear and stable regulations, political commitments, derisking instruments
Chapter 5 | Security, affordability and sustainability

241

and concessional finance in order to attract more private capital. Concessional finance
provided by development finance institutions (DFIs) can play a catalytic role to mobilise
private investment, especially in low-income countries: it will not be sufficient on its own to
increase investment to the levels in the NZE Scenario, nonetheless its role in enabling
investment in emerging market and developing economies is indispensable.
Solar PV investment is set to increase to USD 450 billion in 2024, not far off the levels of
investment in 2035 in the NZE Scenario. Increases in solar PV module and battery
manufacturing capacity have helped to push their prices down to record lows, but the high
degree of concentration of production capacity highlights some of the challenges faced by
countries and companies looking to gain a foothold in the clean energy economy by
supporting domestic manufacturing.

5.5.2

Sources of finance

Examining the sources of finance for energy projects helps to provide a better understanding
of how they can be scaled to meet investment needs. There are significant variations
between projects in terms of the capital structure of investment, the investors, the financiers
and whether the investment originates from domestic or international sources.

A major increase in financing from a wide range of sources is projected in both scenarios

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Note: DFI = development finance institutions.

Capital structure: Around 45% of current energy investment is financed via debt
(Figure 5.34). Debt financing plays a large part in clean power generation and grid investment
projects. Many new generation projects are backed by long-term power purchase
agreements, and, in the case of grids, by regulated tariffs. These provide for more predictable
242

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

revenues, making debt financing easier to access. In contrast, a large share of investment in
industry today is financed via equity, often through household savings, and many oil and gas
developments are financed through retained earnings.
The amount of energy investment financed via debt remains around 45% to 2035 in all
scenarios. Debt financing increases as clean energy generation and grid investment
increases, while equity financing increases with growth in end-use sector investment such as
residential solar panels, home energy storage systems, EVs and energy-efficient appliances.
There is an increasing use of off-balance sheet project finance structures for renewables
developments in all scenarios: these help spread risk and attract more investors because
they do not directly impact the balance sheets of the companies involved.
Investors in energy include corporations, households and governments. Corporations
provide around half of energy financing today because they are investing heavily in
renewable energy projects. Commercial financiers are also significantly increasing their
capital allocations to the clean energy sector. In the APS and the NZE Scenario in 2035,
corporate investment as a share of the total remains broadly constant, but in absolute terms
it increases by 50% in 2035 in the APS and by 80% in the NZE Scenario.
Households are responsible for around USD 500 billion annual energy sector investment
today. Big increases in household end-use sector investment doubles this amount to 2035 in
the APS and nearly triples it in the NZE Scenario. However, high upfront costs of some home
energy efficiency measures are likely to remain beyond the means of low-income
households, which may lead to a ramp-up in government support for those households.
Governments are responsible for around USD 1 trillion of energy sector investment today
through state-owned companies and assets. By 2035, investment by governments increases
by around 35% in the APS and by 40% in the NZE Scenario. This is a smaller increase than for
other types of investors since government investment and public financing is assumed to be
constrained by high levels of indebtedness.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Financiers of energy investment include public bodies, commercial organisations and
development finance institutions. DFI financing represents a relatively small share of overall
financing today, but it plays a crucial role in financing projects that would otherwise be too
risky for private investors, particularly in emerging market and developing economies. DFI
financing increases 5.5-times in the APS to 2035 and by a factor of eight in the NZE Scenario.
Around 80% of energy investment today has a domestic origin component and around 20%
comes from international sources. Many emerging market and developing economies are
financially constrained, and the sharp increases in needed clean energy investment requires
a large increase in support from international investors and institutions. International
financing more than doubles from current levels over the next ten years in the APS and it
triples in the NZE Scenario. The share of international financing in the overall energy sector
investment rises to 25% in the NZE Scenario in 2035.

Regional insights

• Behind global aggregates lie distinctive regional trends. The regions and countries
considered here – which account for 90% of global GDP, population and energy
demand – have diverse starting points, priorities and ambitions. They also have
varying trajectories for energy and emissions which are informed by their different
socio-economic circumstances, policies, regulations and more.

• This chapter shines a light on the outlook for these regions and countries. It covers
energy supply chains as well as energy itself. Securing positions in the new clean
energy economy is increasingly important for many policy makers, as underscored by
the European Union’s Net-Zero Industry Act and India’s Production Linked Incentives
programme, both of which incentivise cleantech manufacturing.

• Two scenarios are used to explore these regional outlooks: the Stated Policies
Scenario (STEPS), which is based on current policy settings and market conditions, and
the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which incorporates regional and national
energy and climate targets and assumes they are met in full and on time.

• Comparing key metrics across regions highlights important differences. For example,
car ownership is twice as high in the European Union as it is in Eurasia, but the latter
has twice the per capita CO2 emissions of the former. Countries are at different stages
of economic and energy development and have different resource endowments. This
shapes their policy priorities and the way they approach clean energy transitions.

• The chapter also looks at topical issues for each region or country that it covers. These
include the prospects for electricity demand growth in the United States and China,
and the mix of fuels and technologies that can meet it; the role of biofuels and lowemissions hydrogen in Latin America; how clean energy transitions can bring down
the European Union’s electricity costs; the potential for critical minerals in Africa;
opportunities to accelerate clean energy deployment in the Middle East and to
modernise the gas sector in the Caspian region; the role of two/three-wheelers and
buses in India’s transport policies; the importance of innovative technologies for
power sector transformation in Japan and Korea; and how to tackle emissions from
coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

• Across all regions, the energy mix is being reshaped by accelerating deployment of
clean energy technologies, notably in the power sector. Although regional
circumstances vary, there is a widespread need for enhanced action to speed up the
adoption of clean energy technologies by key energy-intensive industrial sectors
which face the challenge of decarbonising while simultaneously maintaining
competitiveness. International co-operation has a key role to play in this.

Introduction
This chapter examines selected regions and countries that collectively account for nearly 90%
of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP), population and energy demand (Table 6.1). It
highlights the specific issues and dynamics that affect them, taking account of their different
circumstances and ambitions, and starting from consideration of factors including
population, urbanisation, per capita income, economic structure, availability of natural
resources and geography. Each section includes an overview of the outlook for energy and
related emissions, and also provides insights on a topical issue. The chapter includes insights
from the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS); in
almost all cases, a further acceleration in the pace of change at country or regional level
would be needed to align with Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario.

General notes related to key energy and emissions trends
Each section in this chapter starts with figures to illustrate key metrics including energy
supply, fossil fuel demand, vehicle sales, industrial energy use, energy intensity relative to
GDP, investment and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Economic data are presented in real
terms in year-2023 US dollars (USD), with power purchasing parity (PPP) rates used in
relation to GDP and market exchange rates (MER) for investment. CO2 emissions refer to net
carbon dioxide emissions related to the energy and industry sectors. Common units used in
the figures include: Gt CO2 = gigatonnes of carbon dioxide; GWh = gigawatt-hours; MWh =
megawatt-hours; TWh = terawatt-hours; GW = gigawatts; EJ = exajoules; mb/d = million
barrels per day; kb/d = thousand barrels per day; Mt = million tonnes; Mtce = million tonnes
of coal equivalent; bcm = billion cubic metres; PV = solar photovoltaics; t = tonne.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

The US economy grew by 2.5% in 2023 and is expected to continue expanding at an average
rate of 2.1% per year through to 2035. Inflation, which spiked in 2022, almost halved in 2023
and further declined in the first months of 2024. Recent industrial policies, most importantly
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
(IRA), have spurred a rapid increase in clean energy investment and manufacturing. In
addition, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued new rules that raise standards for
fossil fuel-fired power plants and introduce multi-pollutant emissions standards for vehicles,
though these may face legal challenges.
Energy demand in the United States reached a high point in 2007 and is on a declining
trajectory to 2050 in the STEPS. This decline is driven largely by energy efficiency gains,
including electrification, with the average annual rate of energy efficiency improvement
rising to 2.8% over the period to 2030. Electricity demand growth accelerates, driven by
electrification of transport and industry, and the rapid growth of data centres. Renewable
sources of electricity, led by solar PV and wind, meet all new demand and displace a
considerable amount of coal- and gas-fired power generation. Total renewables capacity
more than triples from 2023 to 2035 in the STEPS, and the share of generation accounted for
by renewable energy increases from 22% in 2023 to almost 60% in 2035 and 80% in 2050.
Fossil fuels see a significant reduction in demand in the STEPS to 2035 and beyond. Coal
demand has been steadily declining over the past 15 years and is set to fall by 80% from 2023
to 2035 in the STEPS, leading to the closure of ageing coal-fired power plants. Efforts to limit
the impact on affected communities will be essential to ensure just transitions. 1 Natural gas
demand is set to peak in the near term and then gradually to decline, reflecting in large part
the ramping up of renewables and battery storage in the power sector. Oil demand also
peaks in the near term and then decline more rapidly from around 2030, driven largely by
the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs). Reduced demand enables more natural gas and oil to
be available for export. These changes mean that overall CO2 emissions are almost one-third
lower by 2035, and nearly 60% lower by 2050.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Decarbonising electricity by 2035 and achieving net zero energy-related emissions by 2050
in the APS requires faster deployment of renewables, nuclear and other low-emissions
sources. In this scenario, investment in clean technologies rises from USD 280 billion in 2023
to over USD 750 billion in 2035, which is more than 40% above the level in the STEPS. Faster
electrification, resulting in part from more rapid adoption of EVs, accelerates electricity
demand growth. Renewables deployment accelerates, doubling power sector investment to
nearly USD 400 billion in 2035 compared with USD 300 billion in the STEPS, and the
deployment of nuclear power, carbon capture technologies and low-emissions hydrogen also
proceeds more quickly. Total CO2 emissions drop by one-third from present levels to 2030
and by 60% to 2035.

1 These efforts are driven domestically through the US Department of

Energy Transitions Initiative and
supported internationally through the likes of the IEA Clean Energy Labour Council.

The United States is one of the largest energy producers in the world. It produced more crude
oil in 2023 than any country before has ever done in one year, having increased its output by
nearly 80% over the past decade. It was also the largest natural gas producer in the world in
2023, producing two-thirds more than Russia and four-times as much as Iran. Its liquefied
natural gas (LNG) exports are set to play an expanding role in international natural gas
markets in the coming years. It is a large coal producer, though production is set to decline
in step with demand. The United States is increasingly engaged in manufacturing clean
energy technologies, including solar cells, wind turbines, electrolysers and heat pumps.
Announced plans for domestic battery production would be enough to meet all projected
domestic needs by 2030.

Electricity demand in the United States is returning to strong growth,
and renewable generation is set to increase even more quickly
Electricity demand in the United States increased by just 4.4% from 2011 to 2023, but it rises
by 25% from 2023 to 2035 in the STEPS, up by nearly 1 000 TWh (Figure 6.1). The uptake of
EVs accounts for nearly 60% of electricity demand growth to 2035. Industry is the next largest
driver of demand growth, with the use of electricity expanding in many sub-sectors. Despite
efficiency gains, use of electricity in buildings also rises, some of which reflects rapidly
expanding demand for data centres. While there is some uncertainty about the rate of
growth for data centres linked to artificial intelligence (see Chapter 4), we currently project
that the potential impact on overall US electricity demand growth by 2035 is modest relative
to other sectors, with a set of low-emissions options available to meet this demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Electric car sales in the United States increase from 1.4 million in 2023 to close to 11 million
in 2035 in the STEPS, raising their share of total new passenger car sales from 10% today to
around 70%. In 2023, price cuts for key EV models halved the average price difference
between EVs and conventional cars, and the increase in demand to 2035 is supported by
further projected declines in EV costs. Policy support is also poised to boost uptake, notably
through the following: USD 5 billion in federal funding for EV chargers along highways;
USD 2.5 billion for charging and other alternative fuelling infrastructure, including hydrogen,
in urban and rural areas and alternative fuel corridors; and USD 5 billion for zero emissions
buses. There is uncertainty about the pace of EV uptake; if EV sales in 2030 are around
2 million lower than in the STEPS, this would raise US oil consumption by around 600 kb/d
and CO2 emissions by over 70 Mt CO2 (see Chapter 4).
Renewables are set to far outpace electricity demand growth. In the STEPS, they expand by
nearly 2 200 TWh to 2035, more than triple the level in 2023. This raises their share of
electricity generation from 22% to 58%, reflecting the availability of high-quality renewable
resources, the existence of established markets with low technology costs and strong policy
support at both federal and state levels. Solar PV sees the biggest expansion by 2035 – solar
output increases by more than electricity demand growth on its own – and wind output also
doubles. As a result, the share of wind and solar PV in electricity generation rises from 15%
in 2023 to 50% in 2035. Other renewables and nuclear power also increase slightly over the
250

period. In the APS, renewables increase more than fourfold from 2023 to 2035 to fulfil the
ambitious target of fully or predominantly decarbonised electricity by 2035, raising the share
of renewables to nearly 75%.

US electricity demand is set to rise by 25% to 2035, a step up from recent trends, with new
solar PV and wind able to meet all new demand and reduce the need for fossil fuels

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Electricity generation from fossil fuels declines in the STEPS by about 40% from the current
level to below 1 500 TWh by 2035. Coal-fired generation continues to decline: in 2023, it was
two-thirds below the peak level seen in 2005, and by 2035 it is 95% below that level. Natural
gas-fired generation is projected to peak in the near term, after more than three decades of
growth: it falls by 30% from 2023 to 2035, though capacity declines by just 10% because
many gas-fired plants remain in place to support electricity system reliability. To 2035, the
blending of low-emissions hydrogen in gas-fired power plants also makes inroads in the APS.
To ensure electricity security throughout clean energy transitions, short-term flexibility in
power systems increases four-times faster than electricity demand in the STEPS from 2023
to 2035, though seasonal flexibility needs grow in step with demand growth. Natural gas and
hydro dispatchable power plants remain primary providers of flexibility: coal contributes too
but diminishes rapidly. New sources of flexibility emerge, led by battery storage and demandresponse measures. Battery storage complements solar PV very effectively, and its costs are
falling: behind-the-meter and utility-scale applications together are projected to increase by
over 300 GW to 2035 in the STEPS, a 16-fold increase over today’s level, and by 2035 battery
storage is second only to natural gas as a source of dispatchable capacity.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

The Latin America and the Caribbean region (LAC) has substantial clean energy potential and
making the most of this could help to bolster its economy and its energy security. The LAC
energy sector already has one of the lowest CO2 emissions intensities worldwide,
underpinned by significant hydroelectric power, a relatively small share of energy-intensive
industries, and the use of biofuels for transport. Prolonged drought and record temperatures
in 2024 are straining electricity supply across the region as hydroelectric generation falters,
leading to blackouts and forced power cuts in several countries. Boosting solar PV and wind
generation could help avoid future disruptions, reducing the region's vulnerability to
extreme weather conditions and the need for fossil fuel imports.
Investment in clean energy is increasing, yet it needs to ramp up further to meet the energy
and climate goals set by LAC countries. In a record year for renewables in 2023, 27 GW of
solar PV and wind capacity were added, led by installations in Brazil (20 GW). In the STEPS,
current LAC renewable trends imply that installed capacity of wind and solar PV increases
nearly three-times by 2035 relative to 2023 levels. In the APS, net zero emissions pledges
help expand installed renewables capacity more than four-times.
Fossil fuels continue to play an important role in LAC energy systems. Oil accounts for 60%
of current fossil fuel demand in the region, natural gas for 34% and coal for 6%. In the STEPS,
fossil fuel use grows 5% by 2035, mainly due to increased demand from transport and
industry. Several LAC countries are significant fossil fuel producers: Brazil was the thirdlargest contributor to the increase in global oil supply in 2023. Guyana was also in the topten. Argentina plans to become a net natural gas exporter in the near term.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

LAC is well-positioned to electrify both the transport and industry sectors, thanks to the
region’s low-emissions power systems and significant potential to expand renewables. In the
APS, the deployment of biofuels accelerates, as does electrification: 18% of vehicles on LAC
roads are electric by 2035, around ten percentage points more than in the STEPS. There is
support for this: several large EV manufacturers plan to produce in LAC, and the 2024 MOVER
programme in Brazil looks to provide over USD 3 billion in subsidies to EV manufacturers
(Government of Brazil, 2024). In industry, increasing use of electricity, mostly for low- and
medium-temperature processes, lifts the share of electricity in energy demand by five
percentage points in the APS compared with the STEPS, raising it to 31% by 2035. Together
with energy efficiency improvements, especially for air conditioning and appliances in
buildings, renewables and electrification play a central role in helping fossil fuel demand peak
around 2025 in the APS.
LAC is in a good position to meet its energy needs and reap economic benefits as clean energy
transitions advance. Today the region produces about a quarter of global liquid biofuels;
leveraging bioenergy could also support low-emissions hydrogen production. The LAC region
is endowed with rich mineral resources with over one-third of global silver, copper and
lithium reserves. Global mineral demand for clean energy technologies is set to double by
2030 in the STEPS and APS. Expanding clean energy value chains would strengthen
employment opportunities and could contribute to sustainable growth, for example by
processing the minerals in the region and using low-emissions hydrogen to produce fertilisers
or iron.

Expanding role of bioenergy and low-emissions hydrogen
Bioenergy and low-emissions hydrogen are important for energy transitions because they
can substitute fossil fuels in some hard-to-abate sectors. Biofuels are a key priority for Brazil,
which holds the 2024 G20 Presidency and will host the Conference of the Parties (COP) 30 in
2025.
LAC is already a leader in biofuels production. Brazil’s pioneering experience developing
supply and demand for ethanol dates to the 1970s. Brazil is the largest producer and
consumer of liquid biofuels in the region and the second-largest producer worldwide.
Argentina and Colombia are emerging as prominent suppliers.

Biofuels production in LAC today is dominated by conventional ethanol and biodiesel for use
in road transport (Figure 6.2). Biofuels are poised to become a key resource for decarbonising
hard-to-abate sectors around the world, offering an opportunity to build on the region’s
biofuels production experience. In aviation, for instance, global demand for biojet kerosene
is increasing, and LAC could emerge as a major supplier of biojet kerosene in the next decade,
providing 15% of global production in the STEPS in 2035. Beyond the production of liquid
biofuels, solid bioenergy and biogases are also set to play a critical role in decarbonisation in
the region, with heavy industries, notably steel and chemicals, increasing their bioenergy
demand by 34% in the STEPS and 67% in the APS by 2035.
Bioenergy demand in LAC, for both liquid biofuels and solid bioenergy, rises by 20% in the
STEPS and 43% in the APS by 2035. Cropland for bioenergy expands to meet this demand but
254

must be balanced with the pressing need to tackle deforestation and avoid greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions from land-use change. Careful planning could help meet demand for land
for bioenergy, without increasing deforestation, through a focus on restoring degraded land,
reducing land allocated to livestock, and prioritising short-rotation woody crops. With an
energy intensity per hectare six- to eight-times higher than conventional crops, shortrotation woody crops become the dominant source of biomass being used either directly or
as a feedstock for biofuels or biogas (Figure 6.3). Their share rises from around 15% of supply
in 2023 to nearly 40% by 2035 in the STEPS, and about 55% in the APS.

The region is also very competitive for low-emissions hydrogen production thanks to its
exceptional renewable potential, for example, solar PV in the Atacama Desert in Chile, and
wind in northeastern Brazil and Patagonia. To capitalise on these potentials, many countries
in LAC have published hydrogen strategies, but few projects are moving to the investment
stage. Opportunities for hydrogen production vary significantly between our scenarios – 2 Mt
of low-emissions hydrogen are produced in 2035 in the STEPS, and over three-times that
amount in the APS. The bulk of hydrogen use today is in oil refineries and ammonia
production. Local hydrogen production could support the decarbonisation of those
industries and reduce import dependency. In the APS, 33% of ammonia production uses
electrolytic hydrogen in 2035, compared to less than 1% in the STEPS. Cheap low-emissions
hydrogen could also lead to new export opportunities for goods such as near-zero emissions
iron and synthetic fuels, where synergies between the hydrogen and biofuel industries could
be helpful.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

The European Union (EU) is home to 6% of the world population and accounts for
approximately 10% of global energy demand. It continues to be a clean energy leader, with
energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023 declining more steeply than in 2022, driven by
increased electricity production from renewables, a recovery in hydro and nuclear power,
reduced emissions in industry, plus a mild winter. Many aspects of the EU Fit for 55 package,
which is the implementation framework for the European Union Green Deal, are moving
forwards: recent developments include revision of the EU Emissions Trading System and CO2
emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles.
In the STEPS, oil demand in the European Union is set to drop by 15% from today’s levels by
2030, natural gas demand by around 10% and coal demand by nearly half. CO2 emissions fall
by almost 50% from their 1990 level. The share of electric cars in new registrations expands
from just under 25% today to 100% by 2035, and the share of renewables in electricity
generation rises from 45% today to around 80%. The outlook for heat pump sales is generally
positive, although a slowdown in sales in 2023 looks to have continued into 2024: the
growing role of heat pumps in meeting energy demand in buildings contributes to a
reduction of nearly 5 billion cubic metres (bcm) in gas use in 2030 compared with today.
Policy developments in France, Sweden, Poland and Belgium are reinforcing the role of
nuclear power in the European Union. In the APS, faster progress is made, including on
ambitious components of the Fit for 55 such as retrofit targets for buildings. The result is to
reduce fossil fuel demand by 20% in 2030 compared to 2023, to reduce CO2 emissions by 55%
relative to 1990 levels, and to meet the REPowerEU goal of eliminating dependence on
natural gas from Russia before 2030.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The European Union aims to become a hub for clean energy manufacturing; the new Net
Zero Industry Act sets a goal for EU manufacturing capacity to reach at least 40% of its annual
clean energy deployment needs by 2030. The European Union was the world’s secondlargest installer of most clean technologies in 2023, second only to China. EU member states
added almost 60 GW of solar PV capacity, with over 60% coming from rooftop installations,
twice the level seen in 2021. Member states integrated over 15 GW of wind capacity, an
increase of 40% compared to 2021. Expanding clean technology adoption in the European
Union continues in each scenario, with installed capacity of wind and solar PV projected to
more than double from the 2023 level in the STEPS by 2030. Annual electric car sales rise
from around 2.5 million units today to over 7 million units in 2030 in the STEPS, accounting
for nearly 20% of global EV sales. Announced battery manufacturing capacity is set to swell
by four- to six-times by 2030 from current levels. Similarly, annual heat pump sales increase
from 25 GW today to over 45 GW in 2030, driven by supportive regulations and financial
incentives.
European consumers were heavily exposed to price spikes during the global energy crisis,
but there are signs that the outlook is improving. Electricity prices for households fell on
average by over 10% year-over-year in 2023, and wholesale natural gas prices dropped nearly
70% from the extremely high levels seen in 2022, though they remain higher than in 2021.
Tightness in natural gas markets should be eased by the new LNG export terminals that are
due to come online from 2025, primarily in Qatar and the United States, adding over 250 bcm
of capacity by 2030. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, efforts to diversify gas supply have cut the
Chapter 6 | Regional insights

257

share of total EU energy imports from Russian pipeline gas from over 40% in 2021 to below
10% today. This is due in part to efforts to improve energy efficiency and boost renewables,
but it also reflects a major switch away from Russian pipeline gas to LNG, which now accounts
for more than 40% of European Union gas imports.

Clean energy transitions offer an opportunity to reduce electricity costs
The drive to decarbonise power generation and the impacts of the energy crisis together
have brought the cost structures of electricity systems in EUs member states under close
scrutiny. Clean energy transitions depend heavily on electrification and expansion of
renewables, both of which require significant changes in electricity systems. The diversity of
electricity mixes and decarbonisation pathways chosen by the various member states adds
to the challenges.
Between 2019 and 2023, the average system cost per unit of generated electricity, including
the development and maintenance of grids, reached USD 145/MWh in the European Union,
which is 60% higher than in the United States, and around 10% higher than in other advanced
economies. A key factor behind this difference is the cost of repaying past capital investment
in the European Union, which is nearly double that of the United States, and accounted for
a third of total system costs on average in the 2019-2023 period. These higher costs stem
from the European Union’s early efforts to develop low-emissions electricity sources, and in
particular from its work in pioneering the large-scale deployment of wind and solar PV in the
2010s at a time when they were nascent technologies and relatively expensive compared to
today.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Also contributing to high electricity costs in many EU member states is the cost of fossil fuel
used in electricity generation, including natural gas imports. This accounts for around a
quarter of electricity costs across the European Union. While member states have
significantly reduced their reliance on coal for electricity generation in recent years, and
more recently have significantly cut natural gas pipeline imports from Russia, the extent to
which many of them depend on natural gas imports continues to drive up overall electricity
costs. EU member states that rely less on natural gas for power generation, such as Denmark,
France and Sweden, are less exposed to these high fuel costs.
Clean energy transitions provide an opportunity for EU member states to reduce their
average electricity system costs. Continuing the shift from coal- and gas-fired power plants
to low-emissions electricity sources could reduce total EU electricity system costs by around
12% by 2035. Additional decarbonisation efforts in the APS and achievement of the
REPowerEU objectives could reduce system costs a further five percentage points.
Investment levels needed for renewable energy sources and grid development are large, but
the cost per unit of electricity for the grid component is similar to that in other parts of the
world, and investment in renewables is necessary to reduce future electricity costs and GHG
emissions. The accelerated transition seen in the APS leads to a more rapid fall in electricity
costs.
Average electricity system costs are not the same as end-user electricity prices, and one of
the challenges of energy transitions is ensuring that reductions in electricity system costs are
reflected in consumer tariffs. Reforms in electricity market design and use of instruments
such as long-term contracts, including contracts for difference or power purchase
agreements, can help align electricity prices with system costs. The expansion of renewables,
the growth of nuclear capacity and the development of flexibility sources should all also
weaken the link between the costs of natural gas-fired power generation and wholesale
electricity market prices. Changes along these lines are likely to lower electricity prices and
reduce exposure to fossil fuel price volatility while maintaining an efficient balance between
supply and demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The expansion of renewables will not do much to lower overall electricity costs if they cannot
be successfully integrated into electricity systems. Grid congestion and redispatch costs,
which hit EUR 4 billion in 2023, are expected to rise, underlining the crucial need to invest in
grid infrastructure and to expand interconnections (ACER, 2024). The investment required
is necessary to unlock the benefits of renewables and would be offset by the savings gained
from reduced fossil fuel imports. Delays in investing in the necessary grid infrastructure and
the provision of flexibility are all too likely to result in increased congestion and price
cannibalisation from surplus generation that cannot be integrated. Over time, this could
undermine producer revenues and overall security of supply. Further European Union
electricity market integration would also help to foster integration of renewables, ensure
reliable supply and mitigate price differences between bidding zones.

Announced Pledges Scenario

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Africa’s economy is expected to expand by an average of 4% per year to 2030, and its
population to expand by more than 1 billion people by 2050; both factors will require a major
expansion in the continent’s energy system. Renewable energy is growing fast, albeit from a
low base: clean energy investment rose by 16% in 2023, but this is concentrated in a handful
of countries that have favourable policy environments and lower perceived risks. Just five
countries account for nearly 70% of private investment in energy infrastructure in Africa over
the last five years (IMF, 2024). A promising project pipeline in the STEPS is set to boost clean
energy investment 42% by 2030, though high financing costs pose a major challenge. Many
more projects are required if clean energy investment is to double by 2030, as it does in the
APS, and new international efforts to address project bankability are essential in this context.
After setbacks from 2020 to 2022, progress on electrification in Africa has resumed. Access
rates are projected to reach almost 70% by 2030 in the STEPS, up from 59% today. With
electricity consumption in Africa set to rise sharply, financing for new sources of generation
and grids will be crucial. Around 80% of new generation capacity through to 2030 is projected
to be renewables in both the STEPS and APS, mostly from solar PV, geothermal and
hydropower. A positive trajectory has also resumed for access to clean cooking solutions:
new policy commitments and new investment – including those announced at the IEA
Summit for Clean Cooking in Africa in May 2024 – have improved the outlook. For the first
time, the number of people without access to clean cooking is projected to plateau by 2030
in the STEPS.
Coal demand in Africa declines by 16% to 2030 in the STEPS. Upgrades to coal plants have
extended the lifespan of some facilities, reduced widespread power outages and played a
crucial role to support the integration of variable renewables into the grid. At the same time,
the rapid expansion of rooftop solar PV is significantly driving down coal use. Natural gas
demand in Africa rises by 12%, driven by increasing use in the power sector, desalination
projects in North Africa and in industry in sub-Saharan Africa.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Demand for oil products in Africa rises by 13% to 2030, largely due to a 20% increase in
transport demand and the increased use of liquefied petroleum gas for cooking. Subsidy
reforms in countries such as Nigeria and Ghana prevent the rise in demand from being even
larger. Increasing demand for oil in Africa is the main driver for increased energy-related CO2
emissions in the STEPS. In the APS, the level of transport demand growth projected in the
STEPS is moderated by import restrictions on inefficient vehicles, measures to displace diesel
backup, and an increase in electric two/three-wheelers, yet oil demand still rises by 16%.
Although new oil prospects and production are coming online, for example in Namibia,
continent-wide oil production is expected to decline as a result of low investment in existing
basins. Conversely, natural gas production is set to climb by 8.5% to 2030, with gas
production in North Africa remaining broadly at its current level and production in subSaharan Africa increasing by two-thirds. Refining capacity remains limited, relative to
projected demand, and the continent is set to continue to be a significant net importer of
refined products, despite the startup of the Dangote refinery in Nigeria and other planned
projects.

Upside potential for critical minerals in Africa
Africa is already a key player in the global critical minerals mining sector. In 2022, mining and
extractive industries represent over 30% of total exports in 23 African countries, and critical
minerals produce around USD 20 billion of revenue each year across the continent. The
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique are
leading producers, but a number of other countries also contribute.

Note: Mt = million tonnes; kt = kilotonnes.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Spending on critical mineral exploration in Africa is rebounding after years of decline and is
now rising rapidly. The continent already accounts for 70% of global cobalt production and
16% of global copper production. New projects are set to expand Africa’s share of copper,
lithium and natural graphite production by 2030: the DRC is on course to become the world's
second-largest copper supplier by 2030; production of lithium could increase more than
fivefold by 2030, depending on production in Zimbabwe and new discoveries in Nigeria; and
the share of global production of graphite is expected to rise from 10% to 20%, due to
projects in Mozambique and Madagascar (IEA, 2024).
Supporting the existing mining project pipeline requires at least USD 1.3 billion in cumulative
capital investment by 2040, with a possibility to reach around USD 1.8 billion if projects that
are at slightly less advanced stages of development or are seeking financing and/or permits
are also considered (IEA, 2024). Further investment will be needed to expand related
infrastructure such as ports. Among other factors, investors are looking for environmental,
social and governance improvements in key areas, including action to address child labour.

Could 2024 be a turning point for clean cooking?

Together with the Governments of Tanzania and Norway and the African Development
Bank, the IEA hosted the first major Summit for Clean Cooking in Africa in May 2024. At
the summit, 130 delegations endorsed the Clean Cooking Declaration and thus pledged
to increase efforts to improve access to clean cooking. Delegations from 12 African
governments pledged to implement proven policy measures and make clean cooking a
national priority. The summit helped to mobilise an unprecedented USD 2.2 billion for
clean cooking access in new financing from government and private sector sources.
Spending related to clean cooking access, however, is still far below the level needed to
achieve the United Nations goal of universal access by 2030. Capital investment of around
USD 4 billion per year is needed in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve that goal, together with
additional funds for the needed infrastructure and affordability support.
Innovation in financing models is contributing to increased investment in clean cooking
access. Firms have demonstrated more ability to raise debt capital, although calling upon
equity and concessional public funds remains key. Public sector support, which plays a
central role to attract private capital, has been decreasing both in absolute terms, with a
70% reduction from 2021 to 2022, and as a share of the capital of firms. Developments
such as carbon markets and new instruments such as the first-ever green bond for clean
cooking are providing fresh ways to attract capital.

Growth is the common denominator for many energy trends in the Middle East. There are,
however, significant variations between the Gulf Council Cooperation (GCC) members 2 and
other countries in the region, which include Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The region
is a major producer and consumer of energy, and the spectre of spiralling hostilities cast a
large shadow over its supply and demand prospects as well as for global energy markets.
Fossil fuels dominate the energy mix in the Middle East, with oil and natural gas responsible
for around 98% of the 36 EJ of energy demand in 2023. In the STEPS, energy demand grows
by nearly 25% by 2035, while the share of oil and natural gas falls to 92%. In the APS, energy
demand growth remains broadly similar to that in the STEPS, even as the share of oil and
natural gas falls to 85%. CO2 emissions rise by more than 10% by 2035 in the STEPS and are
broadly flat in the APS. In the power sector, the share of oil and natural gas declines from
95% in 2023 to around 80% in 2035 in the STEPS. Renewables generation increases ten-fold
over this period, mostly solar PV. In the APS, renewable generation increases twenty-times
to 2035 and the share of oil and natural gas falls below 60%.
Natural gas demand in total final consumption (TFC) in the Middle East was about 270 bcm
in 2023, with the industry sector accounting for the largest share. Gas demand in TFC rises
to more than 350 bcm in 2035 in the STEPS and to 315 bcm in the APS. In the STEPS and the
APS, natural gas remains the main source of energy for desalination, even with faster
increases from solar thermal power in the APS.
Investment in fossil fuel supply reaches a high point over the course of this decade in the
STEPS, followed by a gradual decline. In the APS, investment in fossil fuels peaks earlier and
declines more steeply, reducing by over 35% by 2035. Much of this investment is likely to
come from Middle Eastern national oil companies (NOCs), which accounted for 20% of the
global hydrocarbon upstream spending in 2024, up from less than 10% in 2015. A major
investment is the North Field West project in Qatar, which will add 20 bcm of new LNG
capacity. This project is the latest in a series of investments which, combined, will nearly
double Qatar's LNG export capacity to around 200 bcm per year. Saudi Aramco also has plans
to scale up investment in gas supply, including domestic gas infrastructure and the Jafurah
development, a large liquids-rich shale gas play. International investments include stakes in
LNG export facilities in North America and Australia, signalling an interest in geographical
diversification.

Opportunities to accelerate clean energy deployment in the region
The 2023 COP28 climate summit in Dubai highlighted the potential role of the Middle East –
especially the GCC – in global clean energy transitions. Amid rising physical climate risks,
many countries are now paying close attention to climate and transition priorities as a way
to diminish high dependence on fossil fuels for energy and revenue. There is huge scope for
the Middle East to accelerate investment in clean energy technologies, based on the region’s
significant resource endowments, especially for solar, significant financial resources in many
countries, relevant expertise in some high-skilled energy companies, and the possibility to

use or repurpose some existing infrastructure. From USD 26 billion in 2023, clean energy
investment across the region is set to rise to USD 63 billion by 2035 in the STEPS, and to
USD 137 billion in the APS.
The push for a more diverse energy system is reflected in many national policy objectives,
including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and investment strategies. ACWA
Power develops, builds, owns and operates desalination and power generation projects,
including solar and wind, in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Masdar, an energy company
partially owned by ADNOC, has also expanded beyond the Middle East, and has formed a
strategic agreement with Iberdrola, a leading wind power producer and one of the largest
electric utilities in the world.
Some GCC countries have well developed capital markets and sizeable sovereign wealth
funds (SWFs), although the use of these funds for clean energy investment, as with all
investment, requires adequate returns. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) hold high sovereign credit ratings for their public funds, while those of Oman,
Bahrain and Jordan fall into the medium-grade category. Outside the GCC, countries such as
Iraq do not have SWFs, have very low credit ratings and have limited access to capital.
However, the recently established Iraq Development Fund was specifically designed to
support non-oil economic developments. Syria, Yemen and Lebanon face major security and
geopolitical challenges, which makes progress on clean energy transitions extremely difficult.
In many countries, actions such as phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, adjusting SWF
mandates, promoting innovative public-private partnerships and encouraging foreign
investment could unlock more capital.
There is significant potential to develop new low-emissions generation in the region. Solar PV
and wind generation increases from around 30 TWh in 2023 to 430 TWh in 2035 in the STEPS,
displacing oil as the second-largest source of electricity generation. Several important
developments are underway, notably Saudi Arabia’s objective to increase its renewable
energy capacity from less than 5 GW to reach between 100 and 130 GW by 2030, though
only about 20 GW are planned to date under the National Renewable Energy Programme,
including the 2.6 GW Al Shuaibah solar PV project. Elsewhere in the region, the UAE is moving
forward with the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum solar PV park, 5 GW by 2030 in phases,
and Iraq is moving ahead with its first utility-scale solar PV project, a 1 GW facility. Natural
gas demand – and supply – also rise rapidly in the Middle East, although this is tempered in
the APS by a much more rapid increase in wind and solar PV generation, which approaches
1 000 TWh in 2035 in the STEPS.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Electric vehicles have made little headway so far in the region, but there are some signs of
change. Jordan cut import duties and saw a significant uptick in EV sales. The market share
for EVs in the UAE was 13% in 2023. Saudi Arabia meanwhile unveiled its first EV assembly
plant in 2023 and has plans to significantly expand the network of public chargers.
Critical mineral resources related to energy, such as lithium for batteries, are starting to
attract more interest, with countries looking to position themselves both as investors in
resource-rich countries and as midstream players in refining and processing, the latter
helped by relatively low energy costs. Saudi Arabia has initiated a USD 207 million geologic

Investing in clean energy solutions and abating methane emissions from oil and gas
production offer significant opportunities for the region to advance climate goals
Note: MER = market exchange rate; TWh = terawatt-hour; Mt = million tonnes.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Reducing emissions from traditional oil and natural gas upstream and midstream operations
is a major part of energy transitions agenda for the region. A number of countries and
companies have made commitments to bring these emissions down: most of the major
producers in the region participate in the Global Methane Pledge and many of the large NOCs
have also joined the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter initiative that was launched at the
COP28, including Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). We
estimate that around 15 Mt of methane are released to the atmosphere each year from oil
and gas operations in the region, with more than half of this being possible to abate at no
net cost, because the cost of the abatement measure is less than the value of the additional
gas that is captured and available to market. Taking full advantage of the abatement
opportunity would require around USD 2.5 billion in annual investment, a small fraction of
the amount generated by the region’s oil and gas industry each year.
The Middle East has extensive and well characterised geological pore capacity as well as the
technical expertise to deploy carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects at scale.
Activity is picking up with the oil and gas industry in the lead. The UAE recently approved two
CCUS projects to capture emissions from gas processing plants with a combined capacity of
3.0 million tonnes carbon dioxide (Mt CO2). Qatar is developing a 4.3 Mt CO2 project to
capture emissions from its LNG facilities and Saudi Arabia is advancing plans for a 9 Mt CO2
hub. Total CCUS capacity in the region is projected to reach over 30 Mt CO2 in 2035 in the
STEPS, but could grow much faster, and it reaches more than 100 Mt CO2 in the APS in 2035.

In Eurasia, which comprises the Caspian region and the Russian Federation in our modelling,
GDP per capita rose over 3% in 2023 to reach a level 30% higher than the global average.
Russia plays an outsized role in the energy architecture of the region, but the continuing war
between Russia and Ukraine, following Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, is shifting
priorities and creates huge uncertainty for projections of energy demand and supply. The
loss of Europe as its key export market prompted Russia to reach out to its Central Asian
neighbours to expand energy partnerships and reinvigorate long-standing plans to deliver
natural gas to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and further afield, though there remains significant
uncertainty around the pace and scale of these diversification efforts.
The energy sector in Eurasia faces challenging conditions. Ageing building stock and industrial
facilities, under-maintained pipelines that transport fuel over large distances, and a cold
climate mean that the regional energy intensity of GDP is 70% higher than the global average.
There are inefficiencies in energy supply, distribution and use. Fossil fuels are heavily
subsidised in Eurasia, notably Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan.
These subsidies total over 6% of the region’s annual GDP.
Eurasia is both a major consumer and producer of fossil fuels. In 2023, fossil fuels constituted
90% of Eurasia’s energy demand, the second-highest regional average after the Middle East.
The region is also a large net exporter of fossil fuels, selling around 200 bcm of natural gas in
2023, along with nearly 10 mb/d of oil and 175 Mtce of coal. Russia accounts for around 75%
of the region’s oil and gas exports, although these have been significantly affected by
sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine: in 2023, Russia’s natural gas exports were at
half their pre-war level of around 250 bcm.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

With current policy settings, the share of fossil fuels in the region’s energy mix is projected
to remain high. By 2035, fossil fuels account for nearly 90% of the energy mix in the STEPS,
staying broadly constant to 2050. Oil demand rises 8% by 2035 as a result of growth in the
transport and industry sectors. Natural gas demand in the STEPS remains almost unchanged,
with just a 2% increase by 2050. This small change comes mostly from the power sector,
where gas demand grows by 7%. Almost half of the increase in electricity consumption in the
STEPS to 2035 is met by fossil fuels. Renewable capacity nearly doubles between 2023 and
2050, which is the lowest regional rate of growth in the STEPS. Hydropower remains the
dominant source of renewable electricity in 2050.
Azerbaijan will host the 29th Conference of the Parties, the annual United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change conference in 2024. It is a significant opportunity to
strengthen the regional collaboration related to energy trade, clean energy investment,
methane reduction efforts and energy efficiency commitments. All countries in the Caspian
region are signatories to the Global Methane Pledge. Six-out-of-nine Eurasian countries have
committed to the COP28 Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency pledge to triple
renewables capacity and double the global annual rate of energy efficiency improvements
by 2030. Kazakhstan, Georgia, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia also have longer term net zero
emission targets.
If announced national energy and climate pledges are achieved in full and on time, as in the
APS, this would move the region’s energy system onto a very different footing. In the APS,
Chapter 6 | Regional insights

269

the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix in Eurasia falls to 75% by 2050, driven by rapid
deployment of renewables and nuclear capacity. Natural gas demand drops nearly 15%
(85 bcm) by 2035, while a rise in the sales share of electric cars from 1% to 20% help to
generate a 3% fall in oil demand by 2035. Coal undergoes the steepest decline in demand
among fossil fuels: it falls about 30% by 2035. This drop in fossil fuel use is produced by a
rapid rise in clean energy investment, which more than triples to 2035, resulting in a doubling
of renewables capacity in the power sector over the same period. It also requires large-scale
modernisation of the region’s electricity grids. These efforts bring about a peak in CO2
emissions in the APS by the mid-2020s, and emissions in the APS are 30% lower in 2050 than
current levels, compared to 4% in the STEPS.

Modernising the Caspian natural gas sector
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan face a common challenge as major gas
producing countries in the Caspian region to maintain ageing gas infrastructure while
meeting rising demand, which is often heavily subsidised. Upgrades to the gas infrastructure
have a critical role to play in the broader modernisation of the region’s energy system,
alongside the expansion of renewables, and as a way to unlock needed improvements in
energy efficiency. Over 15% of the world's natural gas is transported in pipelines that traverse
Russia and the Caspian region. Much of this infrastructure was built during the Soviet era,
and its condition has deteriorated in many cases due to a lack of investment. As a result,
many Caspian countries suffer from power rationing, outages and even blackouts, as well as
major fugitive methane emissions.
Taking action to reduce methane emissions is highly cost effective. Around 10 Mt of methane
in the Caspian region is estimated to be lost as fugitive emissions each year and an additional
2 Mt are flared. If instead this natural gas had been exported in 2023, it would have been
worth up to USD 8 billion. Improving the efficiency of the ageing infrastructure could cost
USD 500 000 to USD 3 million per kilometre depending on the location, while the annual
investment cost of tackling methane emissions to 2030 is estimated at around
USD 700 million.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Without action to improve energy efficiency and upgrade infrastructure, some countries are
likely to see increasing strains on their natural gas balance. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are
already struggling to meet rising domestic natural gas demand, compelling them to reduce
gas exports to China in 2023. In our projections, domestic demand rises from over 135 bcm
to nearly 160 bcm in the STEPS by 2035, although it stabilises at around today’s levels in the
APS. The export opportunity depends also on broader market considerations, including
competition from LNG: in the STEPS, the Caspian region is projected to export 95 bcm of
natural gas in 2035, up from 70 bcm today. But in the APS, these flows dwindle to 55 bcm as
the main export markets start to shift away from gas.
Some of the main opportunities for natural gas-related efficiency gains in the APS, compared
with the STEPS, are in the power sector. Almost 40% of the savings come from efficiency
improvements in gas-fired combined heat and power plants, where 6.5 GW of new capacity
additions come online in the APS between 2024 and 2035 to replace ageing, inefficient units.
270

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

A quarter of the savings come from efficiency improvements in the oil and gas sector,
including reductions in methane leakage and flaring. Methane intensity in the oil and gas
sector in the Caspian, currently three-times higher than the global average, is reduced 70%
by 2030, while flaring intensity sees a decline of more than 95% by the end of the decade in
the APS. A further 13% (6 bcm) is saved by gas heating technology improvements in the
buildings sector, and another 13% is saved by 2035 through more efficient gas turbines in
power generation. Under 12% of savings come from efficiency improvements in industry. If
implemented, all these measures to improve the efficiency of natural gas use would account
for around 70% of what is needed to double overall energy intensity improvements by 2030.
A successful energy efficiency improvement programme requires policies, regulations and
technical standards to curb emissions and to incentivise investment to upgrade outdated
infrastructure. This includes modernising compressor stations, investing in leak detection
and repair programmes, and implementing digital tools for flow optimisation and predictive
maintenance. Pairing such a programme with implementation of CCUS technologies would
further reduce emissions intensity, although this would require substantial additional
investment. Fostering higher levels of collaboration between international oil companies
operating in the region and NOCs in order to share know-how and global best practices would
also bring benefits, as would collaborative partnerships with importing regions on emissions
management in oil and gas supply.

In recent years, China has shaped global energy markets more than any other country. It is
responsible for over two-thirds of global oil demand growth in the decade to 2023 and onethird of global natural gas demand growth. It is also responsible for around 80% of the growth
in global CO2 emissions over the last decade and is now, by far, the largest emitter worldwide.
At the same time, China is a clean energy powerhouse. China accounts for more than 40% of
global installed capacity for wind and solar PV, and more than half of the electric cars in the
world today. In 2023, China added almost 50 GW of new coal-fired power plants, but also a
record 260 GW of solar PV and over 75 GW of wind. Over the outlook period, China’s GDP is
set to grow by slightly less than 4% each year to 2030, and then by 2.4% from 2030 to 2050.
The latest data for 2024 show a major slowdown in oil demand growth in China. Demand is
projected to peak before 2030 in the STEPS, led by increasing electrification of the road
transportation sector. Electric cars are projected to capture nearly 70% of new sales in 2030,
up from nearly 40% in 2023, and to account for nearly one-third of cars on the road by 2030.
When its oil demand peaks in the STEPS, oil demand per capita in China will be around half
that of advanced economies. Nonetheless, in the STEPS, China surpasses the United States
by 2030 to become the world’s largest oil market. Once it has peaked, demand falls slowly in
the STEPS, and is still close to the 2023 level in 2035. In the APS, it around 15% lower than in
2023 by 2035. The final energy consumption sectors account for nearly one-third of coal
demand in China, largely due to its huge cement and steel industries. However, final
consumption of coal peaked in 2014 and continues to decline slowly as the industrial sector
restructures. Coal demand for electricity generation continues to rise in the STEPS before
peaking in the next few years, leading to a peak in total coal demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

China dominates global clean energy manufacturing. It accounts for over 80% of global solar
PV module and EV battery cell production. Its solar PV manufacturing capacity was over
850 GW in 2023, compared with global installations of 425 GW that year, and its installed
battery manufacturing capacity was 2 140 GWh, compared with annual global demand of
around 870 GWh. China’s huge manufacturing capacity for renewable power technologies
provides the basis for continuing strong domestic deployment. In the STEPS, capacity
additions of wind average around 75 GW and solar PV average around 350 GW through to
2030, adding on average around 500 TWh of clean electricity supply per year. Combined with
expanding hydro and nuclear generation, growth in clean sources of electricity exceeds the
annual average growth of electricity demand, which rises around 430 TWh per year to 2030.
This is what leads coal-fired generation to peak by 2030.
The extraordinary consequences of simply maintaining the current expansion of solar PV
capacity can be illustrated with one data point: by 2035 in the STEPS, solar PV generation in
China exceeds the total electricity demand of the United States today. The biggest risk to this
expansion is the challenge of grid integration. Concerns are arising about curtailment of
variable renewables, though China is increasing the flexibility of its electricity system, adding
23 GW of “new energy storage”, i.e. largely batteries, and 6 GW of pumped hydro storage in
2023.

China is likely to miss its headline energy and carbon intensity targets for 2025, which aim
for improvements of 13.5% and 18% respectively by 2025 relative to 2020 levels. On the
other hand, China is on track to achieve its 2030 target of installing 1 200 GW of wind and
solar already in 2024. The 15th Five-Year Plan is under preparation and will apply to the 20262030 period. It is likely to signal how China expects to meet its goal of securing a peak in
emissions before 2030 and putting emissions on a downwards pathway towards net zero by
2060. The State Council’s newly published work plan on the Dual Carbon Control System
reinforces the government focus on controlling carbon emissions but maintains flexibility on
the envisaged level of emissions before the peak date of 2030.

What is the outlook for electricity demand in China?
GDP growth has become more electricity intensive in China in recent years. In the prepandemic period, GDP and electricity consumption grew in lockstep, but since 2019
electricity consumption has increased nearly 50% faster than GDP (Figure 6.9). Between 2019
and 2023, electricity demand in industry increased around 860 TWh, of which about
200 TWh was in clean energy manufacturing. China’s industrial production and exports also
rose sharply during this period, while the structure of its industrial output shifted towards
more electricity-intensive sectors. In the buildings sector, growth in cooling, heating and
appliance ownership resulted in an increase of around 730 TWh in the same period, of which
about 20% was for space cooling.

In the 2023-2030 period, total final electricity consumption grows around 420 TWh per year
in China in the STEPS. Total growth amounts to 2 910 TWh in this period, roughly equivalent
to the combined electricity consumption of the European Union and Korea today. By 2030,
China’s per capita electricity consumption overtakes that of advanced economies as a group
(Figure 6.10). Its electricity consumption is dominated by the industry sector, and per capita
industrial electricity consumption exceeds that of Japan and Korea by 2030. In contrast,
electricity consumption per capita in its buildings sector is projected in the STEPS to remain
below that of advanced economies in 2030.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Continued economic growth, rising incomes and manufacturing output all contribute to
higher electricity demand. Electrification is also a major factor. Energy consumption in China
is already more electrified than that of advanced economies as a group when measured as
the share of electricity in total final consumption. The share of electricity in final consumption
in China exceeded that of oil in 2023. By 2030 in the STEPS, almost one-third of its final energy
consumption is from electricity, and China overtakes Japan to become the most electrified
major economy in the world.
Clean electricity supply in China is more than able to keep pace with this rapid growth in
electricity demand in the STEPS outlook. Of course, it is possible that demand growth will be
even faster than projected or conversely that there will be a slowdown in the rate of clean
electricity capacity additions. These sensitivities are explored in Chapter 4.

India was the fastest growing major economy in 2023, with output increasing by 7.8%. It is
on track to become the third-largest economy in the world by 2028. India overtook China in
2023 to become the most populous country in the world, even as its fertility rate dropped
below replacement level. Looking ahead, India faces a range of challenges on the energy
front, including ensuring universal clean cooking access, reducing fossil fuel import
dependence, boosting the reliability of the power sector and the financial performance of
distribution companies, addressing high levels of air pollution, and managing the impacts of
climate extremes, especially heat waves and floods.
The population size and the scale of rising demand from all sectors mean that India is poised
to experience more energy demand growth than any other country over the next decade. In
the STEPS, India is on track to add over 12 000 cars every day to its roads over the period to
2035. Built space is set to increase by over 1 billion square metres annually, which is larger
than the total built space in South Africa today. By 2035, iron and steel production are on
track to grow by 70%; cement output is set to rise by nearly 55%; and the stock of air
conditioners is projected to grow by over 4.5-times, resulting in electricity demand from air
conditioners in 2035 that is more than Mexico’s total expected electricity consumption that
year. Total energy demand in India increases by nearly 35% by 2035 in the STEPS, and its
electricity generation capacity nearly triples to 1 400 GW by 2035.
Coal is set to retain a strong position in the energy mix in India over the next decades. In the
STEPS, nearly 60 GW of coal-fired capacity is added net of retirements by 2030, and
electricity generation from coal rises by over 15%. Generation from coal remains over 30%
higher than that from solar PV even in a decade in which solar PV accountings for twice as
much capacity, owing to the lower capacity factor of solar installations. Coal has been playing
a prominent role to meet energy demand in industry, providing 40% of its energy needs in
2023. By 2035, the consumption of coal in industry would have grown by 50%, with its share
in total industry demand remaining at similar levels as today.
India has a range of ambitions that are set to shape its future energy use and emissions
pathway, most notably is the commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, which is
reflected in the APS. In this scenario, clean power generation is nearly 20% higher than in the
STEPS by 2035, and India has the world’s third-largest installed battery storage capacity in
place by 2030 to accommodate the rising share of variable renewables. There is also a rapid
rise in electric mobility, and this contributes to oil consumption peaking in the 2030s. Coal
use in industry also peaks in the 2030s as industrial use of electricity and hydrogen rises
steadily. On its trajectory to net zero emissions by 2070, India’s aggregate annual CO2
emissions reach 2.5 billion tonnes in 2035, which is 25% below the level in the STEPS.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Two/three-wheelers and buses lead the EV revolution in India
India is one of the largest markets in the world for two/three-wheel vehicles, and the fourthlargest passenger car market. Over the next decade, India adds over 37 million cars and over
75 million two/three-wheelers to its roads in the STEPS. While an increasing share of vehicle

sales are electric, the simultaneous growth of internal combustion engine vehicles results in
oil demand from road transport rising 40% by 2035 in the STEPS, contributing to an increased
dependence on oil imports. Adding over 12 000 additional cars every day in India places
significant further demands on road infrastructure, exacerbates already poor air quality, and
contributes to a 30% rise in CO2 emissions from all road passenger transport by 2035. In
response to these challenges, the government is planning to promote road transport
electrification, scale up light urban rail and other public transport, strengthen regulations on
fuel efficiency, step up the blending of biofuels in gasoline, and support compressed natural
gas as an alternative fuel.
While many of these measures contribute to reductions in oil demand and emissions across
the scenarios, the rapid scaling up of EVs is poised to have the biggest impact. India already
has a range of policies in place that promote the electrification of road transport. Over the
past few years, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme
offered subsidies to support the electrification of over 1.3 million EVs of varying kinds,
achieving between 55-84% of its original targets across a range of vehicle types, including
buses, passenger cars, and two/three-wheelers (ICCT, 2024). The second phase of FAME
ended in March 2024. In September 2024, the national government announced the PM
Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM e-DRIVE) programme which
seeks to incentivise the uptake of 2.8 million electric two/three-wheelers and over
14 000 electric buses. It also supports the installation of over 22 000 fast chargers. In addition
to the national government’s incentives, several state governments in India have additional
demand incentives in the form of subsidies, tax breaks and incentives to promote charging
infrastructure. In addition, cities including Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra and Amritsar in
Punjab have created comprehensive mobility plans that explicitly include EVs within overall
transport infrastructure planning (IEA, 2023).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

India’s stated objective to support the electrification of buses and two/three-wheelers is
noteworthy, since many commuters rely on public transport and two/three-wheelers for
transport. Passenger car ownership rates remain well below the global average. There are
35 cars for every 1 000 people in India, compared with a global average of 162 per
1 000 people and 480 per 1 000 people in advanced economies. On average, people living in
India travel only one-eighth as far by car each year as those in advanced economies. Yet there
are 157 two/three-wheelers per 1 000 people, 50% more than the global average and more
than 2.5-times as many as in advanced economies.
Thanks partly to available incentives, 5% of two-wheelers, 50% of three-wheelers and 7% of
buses sold in India today are electric. Over the next decade, two/three-wheelers and buses
see faster rates of electrification in the STEPS than passenger cars because of existing
government support, consumer preferences and the state of market development. With the
net zero emissions by 2070 pathway in India, which is reflected in the APS, EVs account for a
larger share of vehicle sales – especially for passenger cars – by 2035 than they do in the
STEPS. Electric bus sales in the STEPS, on the other hand, are already similar to the APS
trajectory as a result of existing government support and market activity. As a result of
278

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

increased vehicle electrification, efficiency and uptake of biofuels in APS, both oil demand
and CO2 emissions from road passenger vehicles are around 17% lower in the APS by 2035
than in the STEPS. While they continue to rise in the coming years, both oil consumption and
CO2 emissions also begin to decline in the APS by the mid-2030s, while they keep rising in the
STEPS. Combustion-related air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen
oxides (NOX) in passenger road transport decline in both scenarios, with reductions
stemming from improved fuel standards as well as vehicle electrification, but they decline
further in the APS, where the level of these air pollutants is around 10% lower by 2035 than
in the STEPS. Electrification of road transport in line with the net zero emissions by
2070 ambition therefore presents multiple benefits to India’s environment and economy.

Japan is the second-largest and Korea the fourth-largest economies in the Asia Pacific region.
While there are many differences between these two countries, their economies and energy
systems have some common features: relatively low and stable growth and inflation rates;
ageing populations and falling birth rates; substantial capacity to generate electricity from
nuclear power; and major hard-to-abate industrial sectors. Energy-intensive industries today
account for 22% of total energy use in Japan and Korea, compared with 15% globally; 96% of
energy for those industries is sourced from fossil fuels, nearly all of which are imported.
Fossil fuel demand is set to fall continuously as populations shrink and energy efficiency
improves. Much has already been done to boost energy efficiency, which has improved by
30% since 2000. However, energy efficiency needs to improve by a further 25% by 2035,
driving a total energy demand reduction of 5% to deliver the CO2 reductions seen in the APS.
Both countries are taking steps to bring about more gains in energy efficiency. In Korea, the
Special Act on the Promotion of Distributed Energy took effect in June 2024 to complement
the current centralised power system and prevent the unnecessary expansion of the
transmission network. Japan’s new energy efficiency technology strategy, approved in 2024,
highlights important technologies for each energy sector, including non-fossil fuel sources
such as hydrogen, ammonia and synthetic methane.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

In the APS, the share of electricity generation from renewables in the two countries
combined increases from 18% today to 48% in 2035, while the share of electricity generation
from nuclear increases from 17% to 26%. Japan established the Basic Policy for the
Realisation of Green Transformation to raise public and private investment and strengthen
support for low-emissions technologies. In the wake of this policy, a new carbon capture and
storage (CCS) law was adopted in 2024 to foster a business environment to spur CCS projects
by 2030. The Hydrogen Society Promotion Act was also adopted to reduce the price gap
between hydrogen and conventional fuels, with subsidies of Japanese yen (JPY) 3 trillion
available over the next 15 years. In Korea, the 11th Basic Plan for Long-term Electricity Supply
and Demand (11th Basic Plan) will be finalised in late 2024 to boost power generation from
carbon-free sources. Korea launched the world's first clean hydrogen power bidding market
in May 2024. In addition, Korea commissioned the 30 000 tonne per year Incheon Liquefied
Hydrogen Plant. Recent policy changes are promoting nuclear expansion in Korea, witnessed
by the commissioning of the Shin Hanul Unit 2 in 2024. Restarting existing reactors remains
a priority for Japan to achieve its 2030 targets and energy security. It plans to restart two
reactors in 2024 to add to the two restarted last year.
Meeting the goals of the APS requires a boost in annual clean energy investment in Japan
and Korea from USD 120 billion to over USD 180 billion by 2035. Korea has announced Korean
won (KRW) 420 trillion in policy loans to support clean energy technologies and to reduce
emissions, together with a plan of KRW 9 trillion fund to finance green energy sources. In
Japan, the world’s first sovereign transition bonds were issued in 2024 as part of a plan to
raise more than JPY 150 trillion through public and private financing over the next decade.
In addition to accelerating decarbonisation of their economies, these measures to support
new green energy investment help to reduce energy import dependence in Japan and Korea.

Conventional and innovative technologies advance energy security and clean
energy transitions
Japan and Korea have significant energy- and carbon-intensive industry sectors which
account for approximately 30% of GDP for each. Most energy used in industry is imported,
which creates a priority for energy security during energy transitions. In the APS, energy
supplies in Japan and Korea are underpinned by a variety of sources over the next decade as
they pivot to increased use of clean energy sources – including renewables, nuclear and lowemissions fuels – to reduce emissions and secure supply (Figure 6.12). Although the share of
fossil fuels in power generation decreases through to 2035 and beyond, natural gas
continues to provide stable and flexible power for both countries in light of limited domestic
supply options or interconnections with neighbouring countries. Natural gas is projected to
remain an important energy source, accounting for nearly 12% of the power mix in 2035 in
the APS, though gas-fired power drops to just 3% by 2050.

Measures to reduce GHG emissions from natural gas use, decrease reliance on fossil fuels
and increase use of clean energy are required to achieve the ambitions in the APS

Nuclear, an important clean energy source for stable electricity supply, accounts for over
15% of electricity generation in Japan and Korea today. In Korea, the draft of the 11th Basic
Plan, which is due for adoption in late 2024, puts emphasis on more nuclear and less coal for
power generation. Up to three new large-scale nuclear power units are being considered in
the plan. In Japan, the Sixth Strategic Energy Plan and the Green Transformation bill support
the role of nuclear to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Policy support in both countries
is expected to increase the share of nuclear to over 25% by 2035 in the APS. Both countries
have underlined the crucial importance of ensuring efficient and effective safety regulation.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Beyond conventional energy sources, both countries need new technologies to decarbonise
their economies and improve supply security. Hydrogen has a major part to play, enabled by
ammonia, a derivative of hydrogen. Ammonia is relatively easy to transport long distances,
so it can be used to supplement variable generation from renewables in which capacity is
limited in both countries by land availability. Although hydrogen and ammonia only provide
4% of power in the APS by 2035, they have a key role as dispatchable low-carbon fuels. Japan
and Korea are among the few countries with a stated policy to use hydrogen for power
generation and are likely to have an important role in driving technological progress as the
biggest consumers of hydrogen for power. In the APS, they account for 37% of electricity
generated from hydrogen worldwide in 2035. Japan began co-firing ammonia in coal power
plants in 2024 – a first step towards producing power from ammonia only.
Perovskite solar cells, which are derived from a non-silicon-based thin-film PV technology,
are of particular interest in Japan and Korea. Both need to increase their deployment of solar
PV, which more than doubles its share of electricity generation from 8% today to 21% by
2035 in the APS. However, both countries already have high levels of installed solar PV
capacity relative to their non-forested land area (Figure 6.13), as their high population
densities and specific geographies limit the amount of land available for panel installations.
Perovskite solar cells can enable capacity expansion without increasing land use: because
they are light and flexible, they can be installed on walls and roofs with low load-bearing
capacity. To lower costs and raise efficiencies, both governments are funding research and
development, and supporting new projects.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Southeast Asia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. It has an increasingly
critical role in global energy security and clean energy transitions. Collectively the regional
economy grew 4% in 2023, reflecting its continued post-pandemic recovery. Home to around
685 million people, Southeast Asia represents 9% of the global population and accounts for
6% of global GDP. GDP per capita in Southeast Asia is well below the global average.
Each of the ten countries 3 in Southeast Asia is distinctive in terms of development, industrial
output, politics and geography. In Myanmar, energy demand per capita is just a fifth of the
global average; in Singapore – where the first IEA Regional Cooperation Centre is to be
established in 2024 – it is almost four-times the global average. Energy development
priorities also vary across countries with different resource endowments, though common
concerns include managing the impacts of climate change, investing in infrastructure and
mobilising international investment, and cooperation via the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
Rising demand from key sectors, notably power, transport and industry, drove a 5% increase
in energy demand in 2023. This slows to an average of around 2.5% per year over the next
decade. Major regional industries include manufacturing, tourism and the digital economy,
all of which are likely to expand in the years ahead. Demand for data processing power and
data centre capacity is rising across the region. Half of global mined nickel production in 2023
was in Indonesia, giving it a crucial link in the supply chain for EV batteries. VinFast, a
Vietnamese automaker, is a leading EV manufacturer in Southeast Asia; around 15% of new
car sales were electric in Viet Nam in 2023, the highest share of any country in the region.
Southeast Asia sees the second-fastest growth in energy demand after India, adding more
than 20 EJ to demand by 2050 in the STEPS. While global energy demand is expected to
increase around 6% by 2035 in the STEPS, it is set to increase by a third in Southeast Asia. In
the STEPS, investment in renewables is on course to triple in the region by 2035, from a
relatively low base, almost tripling installed renewables capacity from current levels, while
spending on energy efficiency is also projected to rise strongly by 2035. In the APS,
renewables capacity increases twice as fast as in the STEPS by 2035, and spending on energy
efficiency is 30% higher, though in both scenarios improvements in energy intensity levels
lag other regions, including India. Against a background of sharply rising overall energy
demand, the measures in the STEPS are not enough to prevent demand for oil and natural
gas from rising through to 2050, although coal demand flattens out in the 2040s. In the APS,
by contrast, demand for all three fossil fuels starts to decline from mid-2030s.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Fossil fuels accounted for almost 75% of power sector inputs in 2023 in Southeast Asia.
Dependence on imports is set to deepen, with the region on track to become a net importer
of natural gas in the late 2020s. Affordability and energy security are priority considerations
as the region considers its energy future, together with the role of the energy sector in
economic development and emissions reductions.

How to tackle emissions from coal-fired power plants?
Coal is the primary power source in Southeast Asia today. Of the additional electricity
generated over the past 20 years, 60% was from coal, and the region has nearly 110 GW of
existing installed coal-fired capacity. Over 50% of this capacity is less than 10 years old, and
over 80% is less than 20 years old. Since the technical lifetime of a coal plant is typically
40-50 years, many plants potentially have decades of operation ahead. Emissions from coalfired power generation in Southeast Asia were 650 Mt CO2 in 2023, equating to 35% of its
total energy-related CO2 emissions. Furthermore, new plants are still being commissioned:
coal-fired generation capacity continues to increase until the 2040s in the STEPS, while in the
APS it peaks around 2030.
The essential condition for reducing reliance on coal and cutting emissions from coal-fired
power generation is to develop clean and affordable ways of providing the energy services
that coal plants currently provide, both for generation and for electricity system reliability
services. This is crucial to avoid trade-offs between the need to reduce coal use and the need
to ensure electricity security and development objectives.
Building up clean sources of generation more quickly should allow for permitting of new coal
plants to be halted, but measures are also needed to reduce emissions from operating plants
or those at an advanced stage of development. Moving coal plants towards retirement
typically requires funds to support their managed phase-out. The Energy Transition
Mechanism arranged by the Asian Development Bank provides one financing route for early
retirement, while a number of other initiatives are looking to develop solutions for transition
credits to be utilised as a credible financing instrument.
Apart from retiring plants early, strategies to tackle emissions include repurposing to focus
on system adequacy or flexibility services, co-firing with ammonia and biomass, and
retrofitting with CCUS. Focussing operations on system adequacy or flexibility services means
that coal plants operate at lower capacity factors, thereby producing less electricity and
emissions, but they remain available for use when system needs are highest. Repurposing
coal plants for flexibility is widely adopted in the APS because it enables the existing coal
fleet to support and facilitate the integration of rapidly increasing shares of variable
renewables. While some coal plants may require minor equipment upgrades to operate
more flexibly, the main challenges generally arise from the need to adapt existing operational
practices and contract structures.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Retrofitting coal-fired power plants with carbon capture or using low-emissions fuels like
ammonia or biomass are other options to cut emissions from existing facilities. In the STEPS
and APS, switching to use higher shares of low-emissions fuels gains some momentum.
However, the higher fuel cost of ammonia means that these plants run at lower capacity
factors than unabated coal plants today and primarily serve to provide flexibility and backup
capacity, rather than baseload electricity (Figure 6.14).

Older and less efficient subcritical coal plants are increasingly repurposed to provide
flexibility or retired, cutting emissions by around 15 Mt CO2 per year on average in the APS

Chapter 6 | Regional insights

287

In both the STEPS and APS, existing older and less efficient subcritical coal plants are the first
to pivot to provide flexibility and adequacy services rather than bulk electricity, helping to
cut emissions from this plant type by an average 3 Mt per year in the STEPS and nearly 17 Mt
per year in the APS over the period to 2035. More efficient supercritical and other advanced
coal plants continue to operate at high load factors in the STEPS, with additional plants of
these types coming online and increasing aggregate emissions. In the APS, these plants also
start operating more flexibly in response to changes in the rest of the power system,
especially as wind and solar PV deployment accelerates after 2030, and this helps to cut
emissions further (Figure 6.15).

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

As a result of the shift towards more flexible operations, early retirements and fewer new
coal plants being commissioned, total annual CO2 emissions from coal generation in
Southeast Asia drop by 20% to 510 Mt CO2 in 2035 in the APS. In the STEPS, by contrast,
emissions continue to grow to nearly 820 Mt CO2 in 2035 as new capacity comes online and
existing supercritical and advanced coal power plants by and large continue to operate in
baseload mode.

The formal base year for this year’s projections is 2022, as this is the most recent year for
which a complete picture of energy demand and production is available. However, we have
used more recent data wherever available, and we include our 2023 estimates for energy
production and demand in this annex. Estimates for the year 2023 are based on the IEA CO2
Emissions in 2023 report in which data are derived from a number of sources, including the
latest monthly data submissions to the IEA Energy Data Centre, other statistical releases from
national administrations, and recent market data from the IEA Market Report Series that
cover coal, oil, natural gas, renewables and power. Investment estimates include the year
2024 data, based on the IEA World Energy Investment 2024 report. Historical data for gross
power generation capacity (Table A.3) are drawn from the World Electric Power Plants
Database (March 2023 edition) and Power Plant Units database both published by S&P
Global Market Intelligence 1; the International Atomic Energy Agency PRIS database; the
Global Coal Plant Tracker, and the Global Oil and Gas Plant Tracker databases published by
Global Energy Monitor.

1 The S&P World Electric Power Plants database has been discontinued with March 2023 the last published

version. This product has been largely subsumed into the S&P Power Plant Units database which is published
within the suite of datasets on the S&P Capital IQ Pro platform by S&P Global Market Intelligence. As a result
of this migration, differences may be observed and in particular for fossil-fuelled power plants.

Annex B
Design of the scenarios

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

The World Energy Outlook-2024 (WEO-2024) explores three main scenarios in the analysis in
the chapters. These scenarios are not predictions – the IEA does not have a single view on
the future of the energy system. The scenario descriptions are:


The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) explores how energy systems evolve under today’s
policies and private sector momentum. The scenario is not developed with a particular
outcome in mind, but rather explores where current efforts are likely to lead global
energy systems. The STEPS does not take for granted that all government targets will be
achieved. Instead, it takes a granular, sector-by-sector look at the concrete policies and
measures in effect as of August 2024, and assesses their impact on energy demand and
supply. The STEPS also takes into account private sector action, including fuel production
and manufacturing capacity of clean energy technologies, and assesses how these
market dynamics impact future trends. A snapshot of the major policies considered in
the STEPS is presented in Tables B.6 to B.11. These tables also include key national
targets that are met or exceeded as a result of this bottom-up assessment.



The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that governments will meet all climate
commitments, including their Nationally Determined Contributions and longer-term net
zero emissions targets. The APS starts from the policies and trends in the STEPS and
identifies additional efforts needed to reach national climate and energy targets. In
some cases, one national target may require other targets to not be achieved exactly by
the date or in the manner specified. In most cases, national long-term net zero emissions
targets are achieved in the APS. Still, other interim targets have a strong influence on
the pathways in which countries achieve their long-term targets. Countries without
ambitious long-term pledges are assumed to benefit in this scenario from the
accelerated cost reductions and wider availability of clean energy technologies. The list
of climate and energy targets considered in the APS is in Tables B.6 to B.11, and can be
explored in more detail through the IEA Climate Pledges Explorer. 1



The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) Scenario depicts a narrow but achievable
pathway for the global energy sector to reach net zero energy-related CO2 emissions by
2050 by deploying a wide portfolio of clean energy technologies and without offsets
from land-use measures. It recognises that achieving net zero energy sector CO2
emissions by 2050 depends on fair and effective global co-operation, with advanced
economies taking the lead and reaching net zero emissions earlier in the NZE Scenario
than emerging market and developing economies. This scenario also achieves universal
modern energy access by 2030, consistent with the energy-related targets of the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The NZE Scenario is consistent with limiting the
global temperature rise to 1.5 °C (with at least a 50% probability) with limited overshoot.



Population is a major determinant of many of the trends in the Outlook. We use the
medium variant of the United Nations projections as the basis for population growth in
all scenarios, but this is naturally subject to a degree of uncertainty.



On average, the rate of population growth is assumed to slow over time, but the global
population approaches 9.7 billion by 2050 (Table B.1).



Around three-fifths of the increase over the projection period to 2050 is in Africa and
around a further quarter is in the Asia Pacific region.



The share of the world’s population living in towns and cities has been rising steadily, a
trend that is projected to continue over the period to 2050. In aggregate, this means
that virtually all of the 1.7 billion increase in global population over the period is added
to cities and towns.



There are 75 direct carbon pricing instruments in place today, covering around
50 countries and 40 sub-national jurisdictions. Global carbon pricing revenues in 2023
increased by 7% from 2022 levels, to around USD 105 billion (World Bank, 2024b).



Existing and scheduled CO2 pricing schemes are reflected in the STEPS, covering
electricity generation, industry, energy production sectors and other end-use sectors,
e.g. aviation, road transport and buildings, where applicable.



In the APS, higher CO2 prices are introduced across all regions with net zero emissions
pledges. No explicit pricing is assumed in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa)
and developing Asia. Instead, these regions rely on direct policy interventions to drive
decarbonisation in the APS.



In the NZE Scenario, CO2 prices cover all regions and rise rapidly across all advanced
economies as well as in prominent emerging market economies with net zero emissions
pledges, including China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa. CO2 prices are lower,
but nevertheless rising in other emerging market and developing economies such as

Annex B | Design of the scenarios

329

B

North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia). CO2 prices
are lower in the remaining emerging market and developing economies, as it is assumed
they pursue more direct policies to adapt and transform their energy systems.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.



330

All scenarios consider the effects of other policy measures alongside CO2 pricing, such
as coal phase out plans, efficiency standards and renewable targets (Tables B.6 - B.11).
These policies interact with carbon pricing; therefore, CO2 pricing is not the marginal
cost of abatement as is often the case in other modelling approaches.



The World Energy Outlook supply modelling relies on estimates of the remaining
technically recoverable resources, rather than the (often more widely quoted) numbers
for proven reserves. Resource estimates are subject to a considerable degree of
uncertainty, as well as the distinction in the analysis between conventional and
unconventional resource types.



Overall, the remaining technical recoverable resources of fossil fuels remain similar to
the World Energy Outlook-2023. All fuels are at a level comfortably sufficient to meet
the projections of global energy demand growth to 2050 in all scenarios. Remaining
technically recoverable resources of US tight oil (crude plus condensate) total more than
190 billion barrels.



Overall, the gradual depletion of resources (at a pace that varies by scenario) means that
operators have to develop more difficult and complex reservoirs. This tends to push up
production costs over time, although this effect is offset by the assumed continuous
adoption of new, more efficient production technologies and practices.



World coal resources are made up of various types of coal: around 80% is steam and
coking coal and the remainder is lignite. Close to 85% of coal resources are located in
Asia and North America.



All costs are expressed in year-2023 market exchange rate US dollars.



Major contributors to the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) include: overnight capital
costs; capacity factor that describes the average output over the year relative to the
maximum rated capacity (typical values provided); cost of fuel inputs; plus operation
and maintenance. Economic lifetime assumptions are 25 years for solar PV, and onshore
and offshore wind.



Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) assumptions reflect market data and survey
information provided through the Cost of Capital Observatory (IEA, 2023), updated
analysis for utility-scale solar PV in the World Energy Outlook-2020 (IEA, 2020), with a
range of 4-7%, and for offshore wind analysis from the Offshore Wind Outlook 2019 (IEA,
2019) with a range of 5-8%. Onshore wind was assumed to have the same WACC as
utility-scale solar PV. A standard WACC was assumed for nuclear power, coal-fired and
gas-fired power plants (8-9% based on the stage of economic development).



The value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE) incorporates information on
both costs and the value provided to the system. Based on the LCOE, estimates of
energy, capacity and flexibility value are incorporated to provide a more complete
metric of competitiveness for power generation technologies.



Fuel, CO2 and operation and maintenance costs reflect the average over the ten years
following the indicated date in the projections (and therefore vary by scenario in 2023).



Solar PV and wind costs do not include the cost of energy storage technologies, such as
utility-scale batteries.



The capital costs for nuclear power represent the “nth-of-a-kind” costs for new reactor
designs, with substantial cost reductions from the first-of-a-kind projects.



Electricity generation costs reflect all costs related to power plants and storage,
expressed per unit of electricity generation. This includes capital recovery, fuel, CO2 and

construction costs to install the module.



Iron-based steel production costs display a range considering technology and regional
differences, e.g. capital expenditure, operating expenditure and learning rate, and
differentiate between conventional and innovative production routes. Levelised cost of
production includes estimated iron ore prices, carbon prices and fuel subsidies
differentiated by region and scenario, and are weighted by regional deployment.
Conventional routes are blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) and direct reduced
iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF). The innovative routes are BF-BOFs with carbon
capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), DRI-EAF with CCUS, and 100% electrolytic
hydrogen-based DRI-EAF.

Policies

The policy actions taken by governments are key inputs in the World Energy Outlook. An
overview of the policies and measures that are considered in the various scenarios is included
in Tables B.6 to B.11. The tables do not include all policies and measures, but rather highlight
those most prominent in shaping global energy demand today, derived from an exhaustive
examination of policies, announcements, plans and pledges made by countries around the
world. A more comprehensive assessment of the latest energy policies by country can be
explored in the IEA State of Energy Policy Report published in September 2024 (IEA, 2024).
This new report tracks key energy policies enacted in G20 and IEA member countries, and
synthesises a more complete policy dataset that can be accessed through the publicly
available Energy Policy Inventory. 2
The tables begin with broad cross-cutting policy frameworks, followed by more detailed
policies by sector: power, industry, buildings and transport. The tables highlight policies and
targets considered in the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS). The aims of these policies are not
automatically assumed to be met; they are incorporated in the scenario only to the extent
that they are underpinned by adequate provisions for their implementation. The tables also
highlight the key national targets and pledged policy frameworks considered in the
Announced Pledges Scenario (APS). Targets included in the APS still can inform trends in the
STEPS. Even if those targets are not achieved in full or on time in the STEPS, they establish a
clear direction of travel that does influence the overall policy landscape, private sector
decision making, and more. These priorities and momentum shape the pathways that
individual regions take across all scenarios. Table B.11 provides a list of key industry and
intergovernmental initiatives considered fully or partially implemented in the STEPS, APS and
NZE Scenario. In the NZE Scenario, these initiatives are often met globally, not just by current
signatories.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Some regional policies have been included in the tables if they play a significant role in
shaping the energy landscape at a global scale, e.g. regional carbon markets, efficiency
standards in very large provinces or states.

used vary from 7.15 to 7.40 boe per tonne of oil equivalent. Natural gas is attributed a low heating value of
1 MJ per 44.1 kg. Conversions to and from billion cubic metres of natural gas equivalent (bcme) are given as
representative multipliers but may differ from the average values obtained by converting natural gas volumes
between IEA balances due to the use of country-specific energy densities. Lower heating values (LHV) are used
throughout.

International Energy Agency | World Energy Outlook 2024

Definitions
Advanced bioenergy: Sustainable fuels produced from waste, residues and non-food crop
feedstocks (excluding traditional uses of biomass), which are capable of delivering significant
life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings compared with fossil fuel alternatives and of
minimising adverse sustainability impacts. Advanced bioenergy feedstocks either do not
directly compete with food and feed crops for agricultural land or are only developed on land
previously used to produced food crop feedstocks for biofuels.
Agriculture: Includes all energy used on farms, in forestry and for fishing.
Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU): A sector included in greenhouse gas
accounting frameworks which encompasses managed ecosystems. AFOLU emissions include
greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, land use, land-use change and forestry.
Ammonia (NH3): A compound of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH3) that is an industrially produced
input to fertiliser manufacturing, typically produced by using fossil fuel inputs to generate
the input hydrogen. With properties similar to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), ammonia can
also be used directly as a fuel in direct combustion processes, as well as in fuel cells, and can
be cracked to release its hydrogen content. As it can be made from low-emissions hydrogen,
ammonia has the potential to be a low-emissions fuel if the production process, including
nitrogen separation, is powered by low-emissions energy. Produced in such a way, ammonia
is considered a low-emissions hydrogen-based liquid fuel.
Aviation: This transport mode includes both domestic and international flights and their use
of aviation fuels. Domestic aviation covers flights that depart and land in the same country;
flights for military purposes are included. International aviation includes flights that land in
a country other than the departure location.
Back-up generation capacity: Households and businesses connected to a main power grid
may also have a source of back-up power generation capacity that, in the event of disruption,
can provide electricity. Back-up generators are typically fuelled with diesel or gasoline.
Capacity can be as little as a few hundred watts. Such capacity is distinct from mini-grid and
off-grid systems that are not connected to a main power grid.
Battery storage: Energy storage technology that uses reversible chemical reactions to
absorb, store and release electricity on demand.

IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Biodiesel: Diesel-equivalent fuel made from the transesterification of vegetable oils and
animal fats, hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), thermal processes such as gasification and
fermentation.
Bioenergy: Energy content in solid, liquid and gaseous products derived from biomass

carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology is also counted as low-emissions
hydrogen. Production from fossil fuels with CCUS is included only if upstream emissions are
sufficiently low, if capture – at high rates – is applied to all CO2 streams associated with the
production route, and if all CO2 is permanently stored to prevent its release into the
atmosphere. The same principle applies to low-emissions feedstocks and hydrogen-based
fuels made using low-emissions hydrogen and a sustainable carbon source (of biogenic origin
or directly captured from the atmosphere).
Low-emissions hydrogen-based fuels: Fuels produced from low-emissions hydrogen.

material production initially (see following definition) – with plans to continue reducing
emissions over time such that they could later achieve near zero emissions production
without additional capital investment.
Near zero emissions material production: For steel and cement, production that achieves
the near zero GHG emissions intensity thresholds as defined in Achieving Net Zero Heavy
Industry Sectors in G7 Members 1. The thresholds depend on the scrap share of metallic input
for steel and the clinker-to-cement ratio for cement. For other energy-intensive commodities
such as aluminium, fertilisers and plastics, production that achieves reductions in emissions
intensity equivalent to the considerations for near zero emissions steel and cement.
Near zero emissions material production capacity: Capacity that when operational will
achieve near zero emissions material production from the start.

fluctuating environmental inputs. VRE includes a broad array of technologies such as wind
power, solar PV, run-of-river hydro, concentrating solar power (where no thermal storage is
included) and marine (tidal and wave).
Zero carbon-ready buildings: A zero carbon-ready building is highly energy efficient and
either uses renewable energy directly or an energy supply that can be fully decarbonised,
such as electricity or district heat.
Zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs): Vehicles that operate without tailpipe CO2 emissions (battery
electric, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles).

Inputs to the Global Energy and Climate Model
General note
This annex includes references of databases and publications used to provide input data to
the International Energy Agency (IEA) Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model. The IEA’s own
databases of energy and economic statistics provide much of the data used in the GEC Model.
These include IEA statistics on energy supply, transformation, demand at detailed levels,
carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion and energy efficiency indicators that form
the bedrock of the World Energy Outlook modelling and analyses.
Supplemental data from a wide range of external sources are used to complement IEA data
and provide additional detail. This list of databases and publications is comprehensive, but
not exhaustive. The abbreviation ‘n.d.’ is used for undated publications.

World Energy Outlook 2024
The IEA’s flagship World Energy Outlook, published every year,
is the most authoritative global source of energy analysis and
projections. It identifies and explores the biggest trends in energy
demand and supply, as well as what they mean for energy security,
emissions and economic development.
This year’s Outlook comes against a backdrop of escalating risks
in the Middle East and heightened geopolitical tensions globally,
and explores a range of energy security issues that decision
makers face as they proceed with clean energy transitions. With
rising investment of clean technologies and rapid growth in
electricity demand, the WEO 2024 examines how far the world
has come on its journey towards a safer and more sustainable
energy system, and what more needs to be done to reach its
climate goals.
Reflecting today’s uncertainties, our three main scenarios are
complemented with sensitivity cases for renewables, electric
mobility, liquefied natural gas and how heatwaves, efficiency
policies and the rise of artificial intelligence might affect the
outlook for electricity.
